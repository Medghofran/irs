However, its measured broad Hβ line responses have been incon- sistent, with time lags of ∼200 days, ∼25 days, and ∼10 days being reported for different epochs while its optical luminosity changed no more than 40%. To investigate this issue, we conducted a new RM-campaign with homogenous and high cadence (about ∼3 days) for two years during 2017–2019 to measure the kinemat- ics and structure of the ionized gas. We successfully detected time lags of broad Hβ, He II, He I, and Fe II lines with respect to the varying 5100 ˚A continuum, revealing a stratiﬁed structure that is likely virialized with Keplerian kinematics in the ﬁrst year of observations, but an inﬂow kinematics of the broad-line region from the second year. With a central black hole mass of 0.97+0.15−0.18 × 107 M(cid:12), PG 2130+099 has an accretion rate of 102.1±0.5LEddc−2, where LEdd is the Eddington luminosity and c is speed of light, implying that it is a super-Eddington accretor and likely possesses a slim, rather than thin, accretion disk. The fast changes of the ionization structures of the three broad lines remain puzzling.

INTRODUCTION  Reverberations, the responses of broad emission lines to a changing continuum (Bachall et al. 1972; Blandford & Mc- Kee 1982), convey invaluable information about the kinemat- ics and structure of the broad-line regions (BLRs) of Seyfert 1 galaxies (Peterson 2014, for a review). As an outlier of the well-known R − L relation discussed by Bentz et al. (2013), the Seyfert 1 galaxy PG 2130+099 (mV = 14.3, z = 0.063) has drawn much attention in recent years. This intriguing ob- ject is a candidate super-Eddington accreting massive black hole (SEAMBH), as it shares the weak [O III] lines, strong Fe II emission, and Lorentzian broad Hβ proﬁle with others  of the class (Du et al. 2015). However, the reported Hβ time lags are mostly inconsistent with the characteristically short lags of SEAMBHs.  Kaspi et al. (2000) obtained a broad Hβ line time lag of τHβ = 188+136−27 days from nearly eight-years monitoring be- tween 1990 and 1998, but their campaign had very low ca- dence (the median sampling is (cid:38) 20 days). In a 2007 cam- paign, Grier et al. (2008) measured a lag of τHβ = 22.9+4.4−4.3 days, which is roughly an order of magnitude shorter. They claimed that the data of Kaspi et al. (2000) is generally too undersampled to measure a short lag, and that the τHβ = 188 days could be caused by the secular long-term variability of  2  HU ET AL.  the Hβ line. However, the time span of the Grier et al. (2008) data is also too short (only ∼100 days) to measure a long lag, and the cadence is not uniform, while the number of epochs is rather small as well (only 21).  Grier et al. (2012) monitored PG 2130+099 once again in 2010, with much better sampling of ∼1 days in median and a longer campaign duration of ∼120 days, but the Hβ lag again differed from previous investigations. They ob- tained τHβ = 12.8+1.2−0.9 days from the likelihood method, and τHβ = 9.6± 1.2 days from the CCF methods with rmax only ∼0.35. Grier et al. (2013b) obtained a velocity-resolved de- lay for the 2010 campaign, but only four velocity bins were good enough for Hβ lags (see their Figure 7), and there are two peaks (∼10 and ∼30 days, and even a third at ∼50 days at the very edge) in the transfer function (see their Figure 15). Their 2-dimensional transfer function shows the dominant re- sponse with ∼30 days from the maximum-entropy method (see their Figure 12). Grier et al. (2013b) note that their cam- paign missed some potentially important epochs, and that this affected the accuracy of their results. The Hβ lags are com- plex although Bentz et al. (2013) prefers τHβ ≈ 30 days. Grier et al. (2017) calculated a dynamical model for the Hβ- emitting region that is a thick Keplerian disk, but their model does not match the late 1/3 of the entire light curve (see their right panel of Figure 2), and seems to ignore the inﬂow com- ponent clearly visible in the results of Grier et al. (2013b).  Once again, this enigmatic object requires additional ob- servations to determine its behavior, BLR structure and Hβ time lag. In this paper, we report results of a spectral monitor- ing campaign of PG 2130+099 mainly based on observations with the the Centro Astron´omico Hispano-Alem´an (CAHA) 2.2m telescope at the Calar Alto Observatory in Spain. We successfully detected reverberations of several broad emis- sion lines and thus have robust measurements of the BLR. Implications for our understanding of the BLR are discussed concerning the presence of multiple sub-structures. We use a cosmology with H0 = 70 km s−1 Mpc−1 and ΩM = 0.3.  2. OBSERVATIONS AND DATA REDUCTION  Since May 2017, the SEAMBH project (Du et al. 2014) has expanded to make use of the CAHA 2.2m telescope to perform measurements focusing on PG quasars with high ac- cretion rates (hereafter the CAHA-SEAMBH project). Given the uncertainties about its time lag and mass, PG 2130+099 is one of highest priorities of the CAHA-SEAMBH project. The monitoring was carried out at the telescope with the Calar Alto Faint Object Spectrograph (CAFOS) for 53 nights between 2017 June 22 (hereafter the year of 2017 observa- tions) and 2018 January 4, and 58 nights between 2018 May 31 and 2019 January 16 (hereafter the year of 2018 observa- tions). The strategy of observations is similar to that of the SEAMBH campaign performed at the Lijiang 2.4m telescope of the Yunnan Observatories, Chinese Academy of Sciences (Du et al. 2014). For each night, broadband images of the  object were obtained, then a long slit with a projected width of 3.(cid:48)(cid:48)0 was carefully oriented and the spectra of the object and a nearby non-varying comparison star were taken simul- taneously. The typical displacement between the object and comparison star perpendicular to the slit direction was less than 0.5 pixel (0.(cid:48)(cid:48)265), meaning that both are similarly af- fected by seeing losses, and thus enabling high-accurate ﬂux calibration (the typical seeing was less than 2 arcsec). The position angle of the comparison star is 248◦, and its angu- lar separation from PG2130+099 is 86(cid:48)(cid:48). The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS; York et al. 2000) gives the magnitude of the comparison star in g band as 15.1. Our spectra show the comparison to be a G-type star. The typical S/N of the com- parison star is ∼50 per pixel around 5200 ˚A, corresponding to the Hβ wavelength range of PG 2130+099 in the observed frame, which is sufﬁcient for our requirement of ﬂux calibra- tion. We also restricted the airmass in most observations to be less than 1.2 to minimize the effect of atmospheric differ- ential refraction.  2.1. Photometry  The photometric images were obtained by CAFOS in di- rect imaging mode with a Johnson V ﬁlter. Typically, three exposures of 20 s were taken each individual night. The im- ages were reduced following standard IRAF procedures. The ﬂux of the object and the comparison star were measured through a circular aperture with radius of 2.(cid:48)1, and differential magnitudes were obtained relative to 17 other stars within the ﬁeld of 8.(cid:48)8×8.(cid:48)8. Figure 1 shows the light curves of the differential magni- tudes for the object (top) and the comparison star (bottom), respectively. The accurate of the photometry is ∼0.01 mag, estimated from the scatter in the magnitudes of the compar- ison star. It also shows that this comparison star is stable enough to be used for the ﬂux calibration of the spectroscopy.  2.2. Spectroscopy  The spectra of PG 2130+099 were taken using CAFOS with Grism G-200, which has a relatively high efﬁciency, without an order-blocking ﬁlter. The resulting spectra cover the observed-frame wavelength range of 4000–8500 ˚A, with a dispersion of 4.47 ˚A pixel−1. Note that the second-order contamination occurs for wavelengths longer than ∼7000 ˚A, and has no effect on our the measurements. A set of calibration frames was taken for each night, including bias frames, dome ﬂats, and wavelength-calibration lamps of HgCd/He/Rb. For the object, two exposures of 600 s were taken during each individual night, and the typical signal-to- noise ratio (S/N) of the spectrum for a single exposure is ∼80 per pixel at rest-frame 5100 ˚A. We took one or two spec- trophotometric standards in the dusk and/or dawn of each night, if the weather and time allowed.  The spectra were reduced with IRAF following standard procedures: bias-removal, ﬂat-ﬁelding, wavelength calibra-  BROAD-LINE REGION OF PG 2130+099  3  Figure 1. Light curves in the V band for PG 2130+099 (top) and the comparison star (bottom). The scatter in the magnitudes of the comparison star is ∼0.01 mag.  tion, and extraction to one dimension. Extraction apertures were uniform and large (10.(cid:48)(cid:48)6) to minimize light loss, espe- cially on nights with poor seeing. The ﬂux calibration of the object used the sensitivity function determined from the com- parison star, as described below. Firstly, for several nights with good weather conditions, the normal IRAF procedure of ﬂux calibration was performed for the comparison star us- ing spectrophotometric standards taken on the same night. Secondly, the calibrated spectra for those nights were com- bined to generate a ﬁducial spectrum of the comparison star. Then, for each exposure, a Legendre polynomial was ﬁtted by comparing the extracted spectrum of the comparison star in counts to the ﬁducial spectrum. This Legendre polynomial serves as the sensitivity function and incorporates all correc- tions including the atmosphere, slit loss, and instrumental sensitivity. Finally, the spectrum of the object for each expo- sure was ﬂux-calibrated using the corresponding sensitivity function, and the two calibrated spectra for the same night were combined to obtain the individual-night spectrum for the following measurements and analysis.  The accuracy of the ﬂux calibration using our comparison stars has been proven to be better than ∼3% (Du et al. 2018). In this speciﬁc case, it is better than 3% as estimated from the scatter of the [O III] light curve (see Section 3.1.2 for details). Figure 2 shows the mean (top) and RMS (bottom) spectra for the years 2017 (red) and 2018 (blue) separately. The [O III] line almost vanishes in the rms spectrum, indicat- ing that we have achieved good ﬂux calibration. A prominent feature of the rms spectrum, compared to the mean spectrum, is the strong, broad He II emission line, indicating the strong variation in this line. The mean spectra for the two years  Figure 2. The mean (top) and rms (bottom) spectra for years 2017 (red) and 2018 (blue) separately. The mean spectra are almost the same, while the rms spectra are surprisingly different in the Balmer lines.  are almost identical, and the variations of the Hβ proﬁles are also quite small compared with those in Kaspi et al. (2000) and Grier et al. (2012). However, the rms spectrum of 2018 is dramatically different in its almost vanishing Balmer lines.  2.3. Other telescopes  In 2018, the object was also monitored by two other tele- scopes: Lijiang 2.4m telescope and Sutherland 1.9m tele- scope. Spectra were taken on three nights at the Lijiang 2.4m telescope at the Yunnan Observatory of the Chinese  4  HU ET AL.  Academy of Sciences, using the Yunnan Faint Object Spec- trograph and Camera with grism G14 and a long slit of 2.(cid:48)(cid:48)5. The slit was oriented to include the same comparison star as at CAHA, which is used for ﬂux calibration. The spec- tra were extracted in an aperture of 2.(cid:48)(cid:48)5 × 8.(cid:48)(cid:48)5. The details of the spectroscopy and data reduction are given in Du et al. (2014). At the Sutherland station of the South African Astronomical Observatory, spectroscopic observations of PG 2130+099 were carried out with the 600 lines mm−1 grating and a slit of 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)9, on 12 nights. The ﬂux calibration was done by scaling the ﬂux of the narrow [O III] emission lines to be the same as the mean value in the CAHA spectra. The set of the observations and data reduction are as the same as that described in Winkler & Paul (2017).  The epochs of the Lijiang spectra are rather few (only 3 nights), while the Sutherland spectra are calibrated by an- other method and the data quality is relatively scattered espe- cially for the last four data points where technical problems caused a shift in the grating angle. So for the consistency of the data set, we used the data from CAHA only for the anal- ysis below, but show the integrated light curves of the con- tinuum and Hβ from Lijiang (green points) and Sutherland (blue points) in panels (a) and (c) of Figure 4.  3. ANALYSIS METHODS  3.1. Light curve measurements  There are several methods to measure the light curves. The traditional method adopted in most RM studies (e.g. Peterson et al. 2004; Kaspi et al. 2000; Du et al. 2018) employs inte- gration over a range of relevant wavelengths, which is simple and usually robust for single, strong emission lines such as Hβ. But for those highly blended emission lines, e.g., Fe II emission which form a pseudo-continuum, a spectral-ﬁtting scheme (SFS) has proven to be necessary to measure the light curves (Bian et al. 2010; Barth et al. 2013; Hu et al. 2015). In some cases, especially for nearby Seyferts, spectral ﬁtting can improve the measurements for even the Hβ emission line, by modeling and removing the contamination of strong host galaxy contribution which varies from night to night due to seeing and guiding variations (Hu et al. 2015, 2016). How- ever, comparing with integration, spectral ﬁtting scheme re- quires higher quality of the data. For example, for reliable decomposition of the host starlight, the wavelength coverage of the spectrum should be wide, and the shape of the spec- trum has to be especially very well calibrated. These require- ments can be difﬁcult to achieve with the [O III]-calibration mode of RM-campaigns since only a constant scaling fac- tor is applied for the whole wavelength range. Sometimes, integration and ﬁtting are combined to take the advantages of both methods: subtracting the continuum by spectral ﬁt- ting and then integrating the residual ﬂux to measure the light curves of emission lines (Barth et al. 2013, 2015).  For ﬁtting the spectra of PG 2130+099 here, besides an  AGN power law, a host starlight template is needed to model the continuum shape accurately. However, the host starlight contribution is rather weak in this luminous PG object, and also the spectral resolution is low; our spectra do not show prominent absorption features of host starlight. Thus, the host starlight component can not be modeled well and its ap- parent variation due to seeing and mis-centering cannot be removed by spectral ﬁtting as precisely as for other sources (Hu et al. 2015, 2016). In fact, the uncertainty in ﬁtting the host starlight could introduce extra systematic errors into the light curve measurements. So in this work, we used both methods in this manner: integration for the measurements of the AGN continuum, Hβ, and He I, and the ﬁtting method for the highly blended Fe II and He II features.  3.1.1. Integration scheme  Taking the following windows of Hβ : 4810 − 4910 ˚A and He I: 5950 − 6000 ˚A in the rest frame, respectively, we inte- grate across them for the Hβ and He I lines. For each emis- sion line, a straight line was deﬁned by the two continuum windows located on the sides of the emission, and then the ﬂux above this straight line was integrated in the emission- line window. The average ﬂux in the redward continuum window of Hβ, 5085–5115 ˚A, was calculated as the inte- grated 5100 ˚A ﬂux (F5100). Note that the individual-night spectra were corrected for the Galactic extinction and de- redshifted before the integration, to enable the comparison of the light curves given by integration and ﬁtting. We as- sumed an extinction law with RV = 3.1 (Cardelli et al. 1989; O’Donnell 1994) and adopted a V -band extinction of 0.122 mag obtained from the NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database of Schlaﬂy & Finkbeiner (2011). Light curves are given in Figure 4, panels (a)-(c).  3.1.2. Spectral-ﬁtting scheme  The SFS follows Hu et al. (2015) with some changes de- scribed below to suit the difﬁculty of decomposing the host starlight in our spectra. Figure 3 shows an example of the ﬁt to an individual-night spectrum. The following components are included in our ﬁtting: (1) a single power law for the AGN continuum, (2) Fe II emission modeled by convolving the template from (Boroson & Green 1992) with a Gaussian function, (3) the host galaxy starlight modeled by the tem- plate with 11 Gyr age and metallicity Z = 0.05 from Bruzual & Charlot (2003), (4) a double Gaussian for Hβ, (5) a sin- gle Gaussian for He II, (6) a set of several single Gaussians with the same velocity width and shift for narrow-emission lines including [O III] λλ4959, 5007, He II λ4686, and sev- eral coronal lines. The narrow Hβ line is not included in the ﬁtting because of its weakness (∼2% of the total Hβ ﬂux es- timated using [O III] line, see Sec. 4.1 for details) and the low spectral resolution prevent a realiable decomposition of it in individual-night spectra. Thus, the narrow Hβ line is ignored and the double Gaussian of component (4) above are used for  BROAD-LINE REGION OF PG 2130+099  5  spectrum, as in Hu et al. (2015). In total, there are 15 free parameters, the other 17 are ﬁxed.  The ﬁtting is performed in the wavelength range 4150– 5700 ˚A, excluding a narrow window around Hγ. We try to extend the ﬁt redward to include the He I λ5876 emis- sion line. However, as shown as the residual in Figure 3, this emission line seems to have a very broad wing, or the con- tinuum around it is not well modeled due to the uncertain host galaxy component. Including this wavelength range in the ﬁtting makes the resulting continuum light curve more uncertain, that the systematic error (estimated by the scatter in the ﬂuxes of successive nights) becomes larger. Also, the light curve of the ﬁtted He I resembles that from the integra- tion method, but with slightly larger scatter. So we do not include He I λ5876 in the ﬁtting, and adopt its light curve from direct integration.  Figure 4 panels (d)-(h) show the light curves generated from the best-ﬁt values of the corresponding parameters: [O III] ﬂux, the ﬂux density of the power law at 5100 ˚A (FAGN), He II ﬂux (FHe II), Hβ ﬂux (FHβ,ﬁt), and Fe II ﬂux (FFe). The ﬂux of [O III] ideally should be a constant (Peter- son et al. 2013), thus the scatter of the measured [O III] ﬂux can be used to estimate the accuracy of the ﬂux calibration. In this case, [O III] is relatively weak and its measurement has extra uncertainty resulting from the blending of the Fe II emission. So the scatter of 3%, which should be considered to be an upper limit of the ﬂux calibration accuracy, is com- parable with other RM campaigns (e.g. Peterson et al. 1998a; Kaspi et al. 2000; Barth et al. 2015; Fausnaugh 2017).  The FAGN light curve resembles that of F5100, but with larger scatter. This is caused by the uncertainty in the host galaxy component mentioned above. The Hβ light curves given by the ﬁtting and simple integration are almost the same, which is expected for a strong, single emission line (Hu et al. 2015). The ﬂuxes obtained by ﬁtting are larger than those by integration, because of inclusion of the ﬂux of the broad wings which are outside of the window of integration.  4. RESULTS  4.1. Lags of the broad-emission lines  Figure 3. Spectral ﬁtting scheme for an individual-night spectrum. The top panel shows the calibrated spectrum (green for ﬁtted pixels and black for excluded) and the best-ﬁt model (red), composed by the AGN power- law continuum (blue), Fe II emission (blue), host galaxy (blue), broad Hβ (magenta), broad He II (cyan), and narrow emission lines (orange). The bottom panel shows the residuals. Details can be found in the main text.  the measurements of broad Hβ. The He II lines are weak and blended with Fe II emission in individual-night spectra and even the mean spectrum, but prominent in the rms spectrum. Thus the velocity width and shift of He II are ﬁxed to the values given by the best ﬁt to the rms spectrum. Also, the coronal lines are weak and blended with Fe II emission, thus the ﬂux ratios of the narrow-emission lines relative to [O III] λ5007 are ﬁxed to the values given by the best ﬁt to the mean spectrum, as in Hu et al. (2015). The only difference between the ﬁtting here and that in Hu et al. (2015) is the treatment of the host galaxy. The spectra of PG 2130+099 do not show prominent absorption features because of the weakness of its host galaxy and also the low spectral resolution (with an in- strumental broadening of ∼ 1000 km s−1 in FWHM). So the velocity width and shift of the host galaxy are ﬁxed to those of [O III] λ5007 in the best ﬁt to the mean spectrum. The ﬂux of the host starlight is allowed to vary, but the slope of the AGN continuum is ﬁxed to the best-ﬁt value of the mean  Table 1.

See the text for the details of the measurements of FWHM for each line. It should be pointed out that  Fvar has different meanings from the calibration uncertainties.  We use the light curves of the continuum at 5100 ˚A, Hβ, and He I from integration, and He II and Fe II from spectral ﬁtting, for the following time-series analysis. Table 1 lists all these light curves. The errors of the ﬂuxes listed in this table are those generated from the errors of each pixel in the observed spectra, and are usually not large enough to inter- pret the scatter in the ﬂuxes of successive nights. So an ad- ditional systematic error was calculated for each light curve using the same method as in Du et al. (2014), and all the anal- ysis below was done taking account of this systematic error. We ﬁrst calculate the variability amplitude Fvar, deﬁned by Rodr´ıguez-Pascual et al. (1997), for each light curve. The quantity represents the intrinsic variability over the errors in the measurements (including the additional systematic error). Its uncertainties are calculated as deﬁned by Edelson et al. (2002). Table 2 lists the results. As mentioned in Section 3.1.2 above, the weak narrow Hβ component has not been subtracted from our measurements of broad Hβ. The ﬂux of [O III] λ5007 line is 1.21± 0.04× 10−13erg s−1 cm−2, mea- sured from the light curve of [O III] in panel (d) of Figure 4. Assuming a typical value of 0.1 for the narrow Hβ/[O III] intensity ratio in AGNs (e.g., Veilleux & Osterbrock 1987), the narrow Hβ component contributes only ∼2% ﬂuxes of the Hβ measured here. Thus, the dilution of Hβ Fvar by the uncorrected narrow component is negligible. Note that He II has an Fvar much larger than the other emission lines, and even the continuum. This behavior is also shown by the strong He II emission feature in the RMS spectrum (see the bottom panel of Fig. 2), and common for many objects in previous RM investigations (Barth et al. 2015).  We measured the reverberation lags between the varia- tions of the continuum (F5100) and emission lines (FHe II, FHe I,intg, FHβ,intg, and FFe), using the standard interpo- lation cross-correlation function (CCF) method (Gaskell &  Sparke 1986; Gaskell & Peterson 1987; White & Peterson 1994). The centroid of the CCF, using only the part above 80% of its peak value (rmax), is adopted as the time lag (Ko- ratkar & Gaskell 1991; Peterson et al. 2004). The error of the time lag is given by the 15.87% and 84.13% quantiles of the cross-correlation centroid distribution (CCCD) generated by 5000 Monte Carlo realizations, following Maoz & Netzer (1989); Peterson et al. (1998b). In each realization, a subset of data points is selected randomly, and their ﬂuxes are also changed by random Gaussian deviations according to the er- rors. The top panel of Figure 5 shows the autocorrelation function (ACF) of the F5100 light curve (in black), and also the CCFs for the emission lines (He II in cyan, He I in red, Hβ in green, and Fe II in blue) with respect to F5100. The bottom panel shows the corresponding CCCDs for the CCFs. The measured time lags are listed in Table 2.  4.2. Line-proﬁle measurements  For Hβ and Fe II, which are included in the ﬁtting and al- lowed to vary, the means of their velocity widths and shifts obtained from the best ﬁts to individual-night spectra are adopted to be the measurements of their line proﬁles. The standard deviations are used as the errors. For He II, the ve- locity width and shift are measured from the rms spectrum. For He I, we perform an additional ﬁt to a narrow band of the spectrum around the emission line including only a straight line as the continuum and a single Gaussian for He I. Their errors are estimated by Monte Carlo simulation: several real- izations of mean and rms spectra were generated by bootstrap sample selection, and the same spectral ﬁtting was performed and the velocity widths were measured. Then the standard deviations of the velocity widths measured from the realiza- tions are used as the errors.  8  HU ET AL.  Figure 5.

Here the values were measured from the rms spectra shown in Figure 2, without the deconvolution in Section 4.3. The blue peak around −2500 km s−1 in the rms spectrum after deconvolution in Figure 6 is not high enough to contribute the FWHM listed here.  The resolution is estimated by comparing the width of [O III] in our spectra (FWHM = 1084 km s−1) to those from previous high-spectral-resolution observations. Whit- tle (1992) obtained an [O III] FWHM measurement of 350 km s−1 (see also Grier et al. 2012), yielding a broadening of 1020 km s−1. We also ﬁt the spectrum of this object from Boroson & Green (1992), obtained an [O III] FWHM of 400 km s−1 after correcting for their instrument broadening. The resultant broadening is similar, and we adopted a FWHM = 1000km s−1 as the instrument broadening of our spectra. The measurements of the widths of each emission line after in-  strument broadening correction are listed in Tables 2 and 3.  4.3. Velocity-resolved delays  In order to investigate the geometry and kinematics of the BLR in PG 2130+099, we calculated the velocity-resolved time lags of the Hβ emission line proﬁle. First, the inﬂuence of the varying line-broadening functions (ψ) and wavelength calibration inaccuracy for different nights, which are caused by the changing seeing and misalignment of the slit, must be removed. Using comparison stars, the line-broadening func- tion can be obtained by ﬁtting the spectra of the stars using  BROAD-LINE REGION OF PG 2130+099  9  a stellar template convolved by ψ. The wavelength calibra- tion inaccuracy is also taken into account as the velocity shift of ψ. We adopted the Richardson-Lucy deconvolution algo- rithm, which is demonstrated to be an efﬁcient way to recover the signal blurred by a known response kernel, to correct the ψ function. Details of these mathematical manipulations are described by Du et al. (2016a). After the correction, the emis- sion line is divided into several bins, each of which has the same ﬂux in the rms spectrum. Then, the light curves in the bins and their corresponding time lags relative to the contin- uum light curve are measured as previously described.  Figure 6 shows the velocity-resolved time delays and the rms spectrum (after the line-broadening correction) obtained for 2017 (left) and 2018 (right), respectively. The ﬁgure in- dicates that the BLR in 2017 has a geometry of virialized motion (e.g., see plots in Welsh & Horne 1991,Bentz et al. 2009), while in 2018 it more likely has an infall structure. However, it should be pointed out that the bluest point in the right panel of Figure 6 has quite large error bars because of the weak response in the second year. Whether or not the BLR kinematics are consistent with inﬂow remains open, but it is certain that the variable BLR has changed between the two years. For the upcoming discussion, we refer to the BLR as an inﬂow in the second year. The exact description  of the geometry should be given by the application of the maximum-entropy method (MEM) developed by Horne et al. (2004), which is out of the scope of this paper.  We note that the lags in both wings could be contaminated by the continuum subtraction. In order to test the contamina- tion, we show the velocity-resolved delays with equal ﬂuxes in the mean spectra in Appendix A. Light curves of each ve- locity bins are shown in Appendix B as well as CCF analy- sis. Comparing them, we conclude that the inﬂuence is quite weak.  The data quality of other emission lines is not good enough  to determine the velocity-resolved time lags.  4.4. Transfer functions  Following the procedure in Li et al. (2016)1, we used a Gaussian to parameterize the transfer function of each emis- sion line. The amplitude, width, and central values of the Gaussian are free parameters and determined by a Markov- chain Monte Carlo method. The continuum variations are described by a damped random walk model. As such, the co-variance functions between continuum and emission lines and between lines can be expressed analytically. This al- lowed us to employ the well-established framework given by Rybicki & Press (1992) to calculate the Bayesian posterior probabilities and infer the best values for free parameters.  Table 4.

Fitting results for the two years are shown by Figure 7 and listed in Table 4, separately. Lags obtained by the transfer functions are consistent with those of the CCF method.  4.5. Black hole mass and accretion rates  The bulge velocity dispersion of PG 2130+099 is σ∗ = 163 ± 19 km s−1from near-infrared spectra (Grier et al. 2013a), but the host galaxy has a pseudo-bulge (n ≈ 0.45) and a disturbed disk (Kim et al. 2017). Using the same slope of the M• − σ∗ relation (Kormendy & Ho 2013) but the half of its zeropoint (Ho & Kim 2015), we expect M• ≈ 6.5 × 107M(cid:12) in PG 2130+099. This estimate should be re-  1 The procedure is implemented in the package MICA, which is publicly  available at https://github.com/LiyrAstroph/MICA2  garded as an upper-limit. Indeed, Grier et al. (2017) made use of a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method to model the BLR and to determine the black hole mass through Hβ light curves, and found log10(M•/M(cid:12)) = 6.87+0.24−0.23, which is signiﬁcantly lower than that from the M• − σ relation. Comparing our velocity-resolved time lags in 2017 as shown by Figure 6 with the MCMC model (Grier et al. 2017), we ﬁnd the model matches our measurements, leading to sup- port of M• = 106.87M(cid:12) as a conservative mass estimation. Using the presently detected Hβ lags, we determine the  virial product  ˆM• =  cτHβ × V 2  G  ,  (1)  where G is the gravitational constant, V is either full-width- half-maximum (VFWHM) or velocity dispersion (σline) of the Hβ proﬁle in the mean spectrum or rms. We list ˆM• in Ta-  10  HU ET AL.  Figure 6. Velocity-resolved delays from 2017 (left) and 2018 (right) observations, showing very different shapes. Observations in 2017 show shorter time delays for high-velocity gas, consistent with the model of the Hβ-emitting region being in a virialized motion. In contrast, observations in 2018 show shorter lags in the red wing, which is more likely generated from an infall. Light curves and CCF analysis are given for each velocity bin in Appendix A.

The fBLR can in principle be calibrated by the M• − σ∗ relation (e.g., Onken et al. 2004; Woo et al. 2015; Batiste et al. 2017), or the black hole masses from ac- cretion disk models (L¨u 2008; Mej´ıa-Restrepo et al. 2017), but it tends to be smaller for AGNs with pseudo-bulges, such as fBLR = 0.5 (Ho & Kim 2014). If we take fBLR = 0.5, we have M• = 0.97+0.15−0.18 × 107 M(cid:12) from the virial prod- uct by using the mean FWHM of Hβ in 2017 (the BLR may signiﬁcantly deviate from virialized state in the second year), agreeing with the MCMC result of black hole mass in (Grier et al. 2017).  In light of the standard model of accretion disks (Shakura & Sunyaev 1973), the dimensionless accretion rates deﬁned ˙M = ˙M•/LEddc−2 can be estimated as (Du et al. 2016) by  ˙M = 20.1  −2 7 ,  M  (2)  (cid:18) (cid:96)44  (cid:19)3/2  cos i  if given the optical luminosity and the black hole mass, where ˙M• is the accretion rate, and LEdd is the Eddington lu- minosity, (cid:96)44 = L5100/1044erg s−1, M7 = M•/107M(cid:12), and i is the inclination of the disks (we take cos i = 0.75 2). The mean ﬂux at 5100 ˚A in the ﬁrst year is ¯F5100 = (5.12 ± 0.25) × 10−15erg s−1 cm−2 ˚A−1 corresponding to a mean luminosity λLλ = (2.50 ± 0.12) × 1044erg s−1 in the present epoch. With M• and (cid:96)44 = 2.50, we obtain ˙M = 102.1±0.5, implying a super-Eddington accretor.  5. DISCUSSIONS: UNRESOLVED QUESTIONS  Hβ = 22.6+2.7−3.6 ltd and R2nd  Results from the two years are shown in the previous section, but several puzzles arise. From Table 2, we ﬁnd Hβ = 27.8+2.9−2.9 ltd, showing that R1st the Hβ region slightly changed in the two years (but the dif- ference is less than two times of the uncertainty, so could be caused by just uncertainties in the measurements). However, the radii of the He I and Fe II regions changed by a factor of almost 2.  It is useful to illustrate the dynamical timescale of the BLR  variations deﬁned as  ∆tBLR =  RHβ VHβ  = 8.2 R20V  −1 2000 yr,  (3)  where R20 = RHβ/20 ltd is the BLR size in units of 20 ltd and V2000 = VHβ/2000 km s−1 is the FWHM(Hβ) in units of 2000 km s−1. It implies that the structure and kinematics of the BLR in PG 2130+099 cannot be signiﬁcantly changed in two successive years but either the ionization structure could follow the variations of the ionizing source in one year, or some physical processes drive internal changes (i.e., some  Figure 8. Time lag vs. FWHM of emission lines. The BLR does not conform to the onion structure in 2018.  local variations in the BLR).  Note that the time lag of He II we measured is negative, but consistent with zero considering its uncertainty. Similar results have been reported for other objects (e.g. Barth et al. 2013). Keeping in mind the result that He II has a much larger variability amplitude than F5100, a possible explana- tion of the negative/zero time lag is that He II is responding to the UV ionizing ﬂux, which leads the optical continuum, as suggested by, e.g., Barth et al. (2013) and Edelson et al. (2019).  5.1. Onion structure  The onion structure of the BLR is quite well understood as a sequence of ionization energy of ions (Collin-Souffrin & Lasota 1988) and FWHM of lines (Peterson & Wandel 1999). The ions relevant to this study have ionization ener- gies of He II = 54.4 eV, He I = 24.58 eV, Hβ = 13.6 eV and Fe II = 7.87 eV. From the ﬁrst year, we have RFe II > RHβ > RHe I > RHe II, following the onion struc- ture as shown by Figure 8.  In the observations of the second year, Hβ-emitting region do not show signiﬁcant variations, however, He I and Fe II regions show signiﬁcant changes, in particular RFe II (cid:46) RHβ (cid:46) RHe I disrupting the onion structure with a timescale much less than the dynamical time as shown by Equation (3). The ﬁrst unresolved question would be to explain the mech- anism that generates such a change in the onion structure.  5.2. Kinematics  2 Grier et al. (2017) gives a value of 30.2+11.0−10.1 degrees for the inclina- tion angle of this object from dynamically modeling, which is marginally consistent with our choice here. We still take cos i = 0.75 for a convenient comparison with other objects without inclination angle measurements.  The velocity-resolved delays of the broad Hβ line in the two years shown in Figure 6 are different. The responding emission line region show a change from a virialized mo-  12  HU ET AL.  tion to an inﬂow on a timescale of less than one year. The proﬁle and the intensity of the Hβ line in the rms spectra dramatically change. It is a smooth core-dominated proﬁle in the ﬁrst year, but multiple-peaked and wing-dominated in the second. On the other hand, the widths of the broad lines in the mean spectrum remain almost the same as in the ﬁrst year, as well as the virial products derived. This implies that the BLR may still be actually virialized in the second year. Such an inconsistency worths further investigations: is the velocity-resolved delays in the second year a unique signa- ture of infall as in those simple models? If so, why the ma- jority of Hβ-emitting clouds have virialized motions in the second year as shown by the mean spectrum, while the re- verberation part has a kinematics of inﬂow indicated by the velocity-resolved delays? Further more, what is the connec- tion between the inﬂow and the virialized part of the BLR? This is the second puzzle, which motivates us to continue monitoring PG2130+099.  5.3. Weak reverberation  The variability amplitude of 5100 ˚A ﬂux (Fvar = 6.7%) in the second year is larger than that in the ﬁrst year (Fvar = 4.7%), however, Hβ is less variable in the second year (Fvar = 2.3%) than in the ﬁrst year (Fvar = 6.1%). This means a weaker response of Hβ to the varying continuum in the second year. That the virialized part of the BLR did not respond in the second year may be consistent with the weak response, but it is hard to understand why. The transfer func- tions are also very different in the two years. Though the mean radius of Hβ-emitting region does not change much, the width (τ /∆τ) changes by a factor of 2 (see Table 7 and Figure 7). On the contrary, He I and Fe II mean radii change signiﬁcantly, but their relative widths (τ /∆τ) stay almost un- changed. This is the third puzzle.  Photoionization calculations and light curves simulations have been preformed in the literature (e.g. Korista & Goad 2004; Goad & Korista 2014; Lawther et al. 2018) to investi- gate how the emission-line responsivity depends on factors, including the continuum state, driving continuum variability, BLR geometry, and the duration/cadence of the campaign. Korista & Goad (2004) calculated photoionization models suitable for NGC 5548, and found that the local line respon- sivity could be two times lower in the high continuum state than that in the low state (their Figure 3) with a factor of ∼8 times change in the continuum ﬂux. In this case, the Hβ responsivities, estimated using the Fvar ratio of the line to the continuum as suggested in Goad & Korista (2014), are ∼1.3 and 0.34 for the two years, respectively. But the con- tinuum ﬂux F5100 is only slightly higher (<5% on average, see Figure 4 panel a) in the second year. Note that the ion- izing UV continuum may has larger variability between the two years than F5100. Its amplitude and impact on the re- sponsivity need to be conﬁrmed by further observations and calculations. Goad & Korista (2014) shown that continuum  variations faster than the maximum time lag for an extended BLR reduce the measured line responsivity and also the time lag in the meantime (their Figure 9). The continuum vari- ability time scale in the second year seems to be somewhat faster than that in the ﬁrst year by comparing the widths of the two ACFs in Figure 5, but the measured Hβ time lag does not become shorter accordingly as expected if the variability time scale is the reason for the weaker response. Thus, fac- tors other than the continuum ﬂux state and variability time scale are needed to interpret the much weaker resposivity in the second year. Detailed calculations and simulations out of the scope of this paper are necessary to answer this question.  5.4. Comparing with previous campaigns  As mentioned previously, three campaigns have been done for PG 2130+099, including Kaspi et al. (2000); Grier et al. (2008, 2012) before the present work. Since the Kaspi et al. (2000) campaign has poor sampling and the Grier et al. (2008) campaign is too short in duration, we only com- pare our results with Grier et al. (2012), which performed a cadence of roughly one day. Grier et al. (2012) obtained τHβ = 9.7 ± 1.3 days, which is shorter than the value mea- sured in this campaign by a factor of larger than two. Consid- ering that our campaign is 7 years later after that of Grier et al. (2012), the difference could be real and due to changes of the BLR. However, Bentz et al. (2013) argued that the Grier et al. (2012) campaign missed some key observation dates and PG 2130+099 should have a lag of 31 ± 4 days from their reanalysis. This corrected time lag is in agreement with the present results.  6. SUMMARY  We report a successive two-year campaign of PG 2130+099 using the CAHA 2.2m and other telescopes since 2017. Reverberations of several broad emission lines are analysed. We ﬁnd that  • From the observations in 2017, Hβ displayed a lag of τHβ = 22.6+2.7−3.6 days. He I, He II and Fe II have lags of τHe I = 18.2+7.3−3.1 days, τHe II = −1.4+6.8−0.9 days, and τFe II = 35.3+8.2−9.9 days, respectively. The velocity- resolved delays of Hβ shows a sign of virialized mo- tion. The BLRs are radially stratiﬁed (i.e., an onion structure) according to the full-width-half-maximum of the lines and the ionization energies of the ions. • From the observations in 2018, we obtain τHβ = 27.8+2.9−2.9 days, τHe I = 31.1+2.9−5.8 days, τHe II = −2.9+1.5−0.9 days, and τFe II = 23.1+3.4−5.6 days. The Hβ velocity-resolved delays favour an inﬂow as the vari- able part of the BLR. It is clear that the onion structure is broken in 2018 with a timescale less than one year. • We prefer the estimation of black hole mass from the ﬁrst year observations. Using the black hole mass of  BROAD-LINE REGION OF PG 2130+099  13  M• = 0.97+0.15−0.18 × 107 M(cid:12), we estimate an accretion rate of 102.1±0.5 LEdd/c2, suggesting that it is a super- Eddington accretor.  simulations of the BLR (Pancoast et al. 2011; Li et al. 2018) will be carried out for detail explanations and better under- standings.  • Our two-year high-cadence campaign shows several puzzles of the BLR reverberations in PG 2130+099. The stratiﬁed structure of Hβ, He I, and Fe II-emitting regions changes, and the kinematics of Hβ-emitting region changes from a virialized motion to an inﬂow, with a timescale less than one year. The mean spec- tra are less variable, but the line responsivity becomes much weak in the second year. It is worth continuing intensive monitoring of PG 2130+099 to resolve these questions.  PG 2130+099 shows interesting reverberation behavior in our high-cadence campaign. Markov Chain Monte-Carlo  The authors are grateful to an anonymous referee for very useful reports.

CCF ANALYSIS IN EACH VELOCITY BIN  Figure A1 shows Hβ light curves, CCFs, and CCCDs in each velocity bin with equal ﬂux in the rms spectrum, used in Figure  6.  14  HU ET AL.  Figure A1. Hβ light curves and CCF analysis in each velocity bin with equal ﬂux in the rms spectrum, from 2017 (left) and 2018 (right) observations. The blue curves are CCF functions and yellow lines are Monte Carlo simulations as described in the main text. The velocity boundaries are given by numbers in the brackets.  B. VELOCITY-RESOLVED DELAYS WITH EQUAL FLUXES IN THE MEAN SPECTRA  Considering that the rms spectrum could be contaminated by continuum, we calculated the Hβ velocity-resolved delays in each velocity bin with equal ﬂux in the mean spectrum, shown in Figure B3. Light curves in each velocity bin are given in Figure B2. Comparing Figure 6 with B3, we ﬁnd that the two kinds of velocity-resolved delays are quite similar. Therefore the inﬂuence of continuum contamination is not important.  0.60.8(-3147,-1305)0.250.500.750.50.6(-1305,-747)0.250.500.750.350.400.45(-747,-410)0.500.750.40.5(-410,-136)0.500.750.40.5(-136,130)0.500.750.40.5(130,412)0.250.500.750.350.400.45(412,720)0.500.750.50.6(720,1080)0.250.500.750.30.4(1080,1617)0.250.500.7550100150200JD-24579000.40.5(1617,3024)050Lag(Days)0.250.500.750.00.20.40.60.81.00.00.20.40.60.81.0FHβ(×10−13)1.21.4(-3147,-677)−0.250.000.250.91.0(-677,-148)−0.50.00.50.91.0(-148,498)−0.50.00.50.70.8(498,1036)−0.50.00.50.450.500.55(1036,1461)−0.50.00.5400450500550600JD-24579000.60.7(1461,3024)050Lag(Days)−0.50.00.50.00.20.40.60.81.00.00.20.40.60.81.0FHβ(×10−13)BROAD-LINE REGION OF PG 2130+099  15  Figure B2.
