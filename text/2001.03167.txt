Wahl1 and Benjamin B´eri1, 2  1DAMTP, University of Cambridge, Wilberforce Road, Cambridge, CB3 0WA, United Kingdom  2T.C.M. Group, Cavendish Laboratory, University of Cambridge, J.J. Thomson Avenue, Cambridge, CB3 0HE, United Kingdom  Many-body localized (MBL) systems are often described using their local integrals of motion, which, for spin systems, are assumed to be a local unitary transform of the set of on-site spin-z operators. We show that this assumption must be revised for topologically ordered MBL systems, and introduce a notion of local integrals of motion capturing such systems and beyond, in any spatial dimension. Using this framework, we demonstrate a number of features, including that MBL topological order, if present: (i) is the same for all eigenstates; (ii) is robust in character against any perturbation preserving MBL; (iii) implies that on topologically nontrivial manifolds a complete set of integrals of motion must include nonlocal ones in the form of local-unitary-dressed noncontractible Wilson loops. Our approach is well suited for tensor-network methods, and is expected to allow these to resolve highly-excited ﬁnite-size-split topological eigenspaces despite their overlap in energy. We illustrate our approach on the disordered Kitaev chain, the toric code, and the X-cube model.  Introduction.– Systems displaying many-body localiza- tion [1, 2] (MBL) violate the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis [3] and therefore do not thermalize. (See Refs. 4, and 5 for some recent reviews.) MBL occurs in strongly disordered interacting lattice systems. Re- cent analytical and numerical work has put the eﬀect on ﬁrm theoretical footing in one dimension [2, 6–8], whereas the existence of MBL in higher dimensions is still debated [9, 10]. However, MBL has been observed experimentally both in one- [11] and two-dimensional sys- tems [12]. This might be due to extremely long relaxation time scales [13], which are unobservable in the experi- ment. Numerical simulations are consistent with two- dimensional MBL-like behavior on short time scales [14].  All eigenstates of MBL systems are area-law entan- gled [15, 16]. This makes MBL compatible with the in- teresting scenario where all eigenstates are topologically ordered [15, 17–19]. Such MBL systems have been sug- gested to provide improved protection of quantum in- formation against external perturbations compared to their clean counterparts [15, 20]. In one-dimensional sys- tems, nontrivial topology requires the presence of certain symmetries. In higher dimensions, however, topological states can exist without symmetries; it is these states that we call here topologically ordered [21].  Fully MBL (FMBL) systems can be described in terms of local integrals of motion (LIOMs), which are exponen- tially localized operators which commute with each other and the Hamiltonian [5, 22–30]. LIOMs are commonly assumed to form a complete set arising as a local unitary transform of the set of on-site spin-z operators. This, however, tacitly also assumes the absence of topological order: it implies that FMBL eigenstates arise from local product states via local unitary transformation, which guarantees [31, 32] that they are topologically trivial. This raises the question whether such systems can at all be FMBL (even when neglecting extremely slow relax- ation eﬀects in higher dimensions) and, if so, how one  should think about their LIOMs.  In this Letter, we show that topological obstructions do not prevent FMBL and propose a notion for “topolog- ical LIOMs (tLIOMs)” suitable for topologically ordered FMBL phases. Our main insight is that the on-site spin- z operators in conventional LIOMs are just one choice of local stabilizers [33], namely those of product states; to describe tLIOMs we must use a diﬀerent set, namely the stabilizers in the commuting projector limits of topologi- cal phases. Since all non-chiral forms of topological order admit such commuting projector limit [34], our tLIOMs capture all non-chiral FMBL eigenstate topological or- ders. This tLIOM notion is very general; it applies in any dimension and its scope even includes putative FMBL cousins of recently introduced fractonic phases [35–38].  Deﬁning topological FMBL phases using tLIOMs pro- vides a transparent framework for establishing a num- ber of features on the character and robustness of these phases, and it lends itself for adapting tensor-network simulations thus far used for capturing non-topological FMBL systems [7, 8, 14]. We next turn to a more concrete exposition of our approach, ﬁrst recapping the LIOM description of non-topological FMBL phases.  Non-topological FMBL.– For concreteness we consider an N -site spin-1/2 (i.e., qubit) system on a d-dimensional square lattice. The extension to higher spin systems and fermionic systems is straightforward. The FMBL phase is deﬁned by a complete set of LIOMs τ z i (i = 1, . . . , N ) which commute with the Hamiltonian H and each other,  [H, τ z  i ] = [τ z  i , τ z  j ] = 0,  (1)  and are exponentially localized, i.e., their non-trivial ma- trix elements decay exponentially with distance from site i. The corresponding decay length, the localization length ξi, must fulﬁll ξi/N 1/d → 0 for all i in the thermodynamic limit N → ∞. The τ z i can be constructed from a unitary U which diagonalizes the Hamiltonian as τ z i U †, where σz is the third Pauli operator acting on site i. i  i = U σz  2  eigenvalues si = ±1 label a complete orthonormal basis. We refer to Si as s-bits. The p-bits and their product eigenstates correspond to Si = σz i and the eigenstates of Hsc. The scope of stabilizer codes, however, is much wider (and not limited to qubits): they capture all non- chiral topological orders [34], from the toric code [39] to fracton models [35–38], as well as fermionic systems such as the Kitaev chain [40] or various other Majorana fermion codes [41]. We propose the following deﬁnition of FMBL and (t)LIOMs to capture Abelian topological order on topologically trivial manifolds:  Deﬁnition 1. Let Si, i = 1, . . . , N be a complete set of local stabilizers on a topologically trivial manifold M. We call a Hamiltonian H on M FMBL, if there exists a local unitary ˜U such that Ti = ˜U Si ˜U † and  [H, Ti] = [Ti, Tj] = 0,  (4)  and the same property holds if inﬁnitesimally small per- turbations are added to H. We call the complete set Ti tLIOMs (or topological l-bits) if Si are the stabilizers of topologically ordered states.  We shall come back to discussing various aspects of our deﬁnition, including observations for topologically nontrivial M and non-Abelian topological order. For now, we note that Deﬁnition 1 implies, ﬁrstly, |ψ{si}i = ˜U |{si}i where |ψ{si}i and |{si}i are respective eigen- states of the FMBL Hamiltonian H and Hsc. Secondly, up to an additive constant, and with cijk... ∈ R,  H = X  i  ciTi + X  i<j  cijTiTj + X  i<j<k  cijkTiTjTk + . . . , (5)  where for a local Hamiltonian and for describing the dy- namics on experimental time scales, we can assume that |cijk...| decay exponentially with the largest distance be- tween the occurring sites i, j, k, . . . in any dimension d.  We next establish a number of features that follow from Deﬁnition 1, focusing again on qubit systems for con- creteness. We ﬁrst remind of the following result [31, 32]: |ψ1i and |ψ2i have the same topological order if |ψ2i = U |ψ1i and U is a local unitary. Together with Deﬁni- tion 1, this means that many features directly carry over from the commuting projector limit Hsc to the FMBL phase. For instance, due to |ψ{si}i = ˜U |{si}i:  Statement 1. The FMBL eigenstates have the same topological order as those of Hsc.  Furthermore, since any set of the stabilizers Si can be ﬂipped by a suitable Pauli string [33], and since any Pauli string is a local unitary, every eigenstate of Hsc has the same topological order. Hence:  Statement 2. All eigenstates of topological FMBL sys- tems display the same topological order.  FIG. 1. A one-dimensional depth-two quantum circuit with length-ℓ unitaries (denoted as boxes). The gate length ℓ is allowed to grow subextensively with the system size [8].  A key feature that makes nontopological FMBL systems special, and computationally tractable [7, 8, 14], is that U is a local unitary, i.e., eﬃciently approximable by a constant-depth quantum circuit of subextensive-length unitary gates [8]. [The error scales as exp(−ℓ/ξmax) where ξmax is the largest ξi and ℓ is the gate length.] Fig. 1 shows a depth-two example.  The τ z  i ’s are also known as l-bits (l=localized) [23]; they label, due to Eq. (1), all eigenstates |ψl1...lN i of H,  τ z i |ψl1...lN i = li|ψl1...lN i,  li = ±1.  (2)  The σz i operators are called p-bits (p=physical) [23]. Eq. (2) implies |ψl1l2...lN i = U |l1l2 . . . lN i in terms of the p-bit product states |l1l2 . . . lN i. For d > 1, the LIOM description might not apply exactly due to delocalization on extremely long time scales [9, 13]. However, in the (ex- perimentally relevant) short-time limit, the description in terms of LIOMs seems to be appropriate [14], which is what we restrict ourselves to in the following.  Topological FMBL phases.– In the topological FMBL case it is conjectured that all eigenstates display topolog- ical order [15, 17, 19]. However, even if only one eigen- state |ψl1l2...lN i is topologically non-trivial, there exists no local unitary U such that |ψl1l2...lN i = U |l1l2 . . . lN i [31, 32]. Hence, if a LIOM description applies, it is not of the form τ z i U †. We must therefore introduce the new concept of (t)LIOMs appropriate also for topological FMBL systems.  i = U σz  We begin by explaining how p-bits and the correspond- ing product eigenstates ﬁt in the broader context of local stabilizer codes [33]. For concreteness, we present the idea for N -site qubit systems, however the scope of sta- bilizer codes, and hence our construction, is much more general. A local stabilizer code may be thought of in terms of a stabilizer Hamiltonian  Hsc = −  N  X  i=1  Si,  (3)  where the local stabilizers Si = S† i are Pauli strings with local support around site i, and [Si, Sj] = 0. (Thus, up to a constant, Hsc is a commuting-projector Hamiltonian.) On a topologically trivial manifold, Si are independent (Qi Sxi i = 1 only if xi = 0, ∀ i; xi ∈ {0, 1}), hence their  i σx  Deﬁnition 1 requires robustness against small pertur- bation to describe a localized phase, i.e., it excludes sys- tems with (t)LIOMs that easily delocalize. An exam- ple of the excluded systems is Hsc itself [which satisﬁes Eq. (4) with ˜U = 1], as illustrated by Si = σz i and H(δt) = Hsc + δtPi(σx i+1) in d = 1: for any δt 6= 0, Jordan-Wigner transformation reveals the integrals of motion as plane-wave-operators, hence not related to Si by a local unitary. For a local stabilizer code with topological order, the stabilizers with si = −1 indi- cate anyon locations; in the FMBL phase these translate to the support of the corresponding Ti. By Deﬁnition 1, this support does not easily delocalize: we ﬁnd anyon localization.  i+1 + σy  i σy  In Deﬁnition 1 we specialized to a topologically triv- ial M and Abelian topological order so that eigenstates are fully characterized by the local s-bit strings {si}. For a topologically nontrivial M and/or non-Abelian topo- logical order, the set of local Si is not complete; {si} label subspaces of degeneracy depending on the topol- ogy of M and/or the anyon fusion [42]. A complete set includes nonlocal Snl required to resolve these degenera- i cies. In the non-Abelian case, due to the nonzero density of anyons in generic eigenstates, the number of Snl is i extensive; tLIOMs give a highly incomplete characteri- zation [43]. Hence we focus on the Abelian case. There, Snl i are noncontractible Wilson loops (e.g., certain Pauli strings for qubits) on M. We can thus complete the set of ˜U †. Therefore: FMBL integrals of motion by T nl  i = ˜U Snl  i  Statement 3. On a topologically nontrivial M, the com- plete set of FMBL integrals of motions must include i = ˜U Snl T nl are noncontractible Wilson loops resolving the eigenspace degeneracies of Hsc.  ˜U † where Snl i  i  These T nl i give an operational deﬁnition of the fattened Wilson loops in Ref. [15]. Aiming at {Ti} via {Si} in a tensor-network calculation [7, 8], one may in princi- ple resolve highly-excited topological multiplets despite the huge density of states. We next introduce an FMBL notion of topological equivalence:  Deﬁnition 2. Two FMBL Hamiltonians H0 and H1 are in the same topological phase if there exists a pa- rameterization H(λ), λ ∈ [0, 1], such that H(0) = H0, H(1) = H1, and H(λ) is FMBL for all λ ∈ [0, 1].  In other words, one cannot connect topologically inequiv- alent FMBL Hamiltonians without delocalizing the sys- tem along the way. Furthermore,  Statement 4. Two FMBL Hamiltonians H0 and H1 are in the same topological phase if and only if their eigen- state topological order is the same.  We show this in the scope of Deﬁnition 1. If the eigen- state topological order is the same, then the two corre- sponding sets {S(′) i=1 are mapped by a local unitary  i }N  3  (with degree of locality linked to those of the eigenstate- mapping unitaries). The equivalence of the FMBL topo- logical phases is shown by ﬁnding a path H(λ) which connects any two FMBL topological phases with local- unitary related {Si}N i=1. We thus consider H0 as in Eq. (5) and H1 = X  k + . . . , (6)  j +X  i +X  c′ ijT ′  c′ iT ′  i T ′  i T ′  jT ′  c′ ijkT ′ i<j<k  i  i<j  †  i  ˜U ′  i = ˜U ′S′  i = USSiU †  where T ′ . Now deﬁne dijk...(λ) = (1 − λ)cijk... + λc′ ijk.... By assumption, there is a local unitary US such that S′ S for all i. We can thus deﬁne a local unitary V (λ) such that V (0) = ˜U and V (1) = ˜U ′US and V (λ) a continuous function of λ [32]. H(λ) deﬁned as in Eq. (5) with ˜U replaced by V (λ) and cijk... by dijk...(λ) gives a continuous path H(λ) connecting H0 and H1 pre- serving FMBL (Deﬁnition 1) for all λ ∈ [0, 1].  To show the converse, we take a path H = H(λ) in an FMBL phase (Deﬁnition 2) and show that the eigenstate topological order cannot change. We take the system size N ﬁnite but large. Take a unitary Utot(λ) which diago- nalizes the Hamiltonian H(λ) = Utot(λ)E(λ)U † tot(λ); for ﬁnite N , Utot(λ) can be chosen as a continuous function of λ. For any λ, we have  ˜U (λ)Utop(λ) = Utot(λ),  (7)  where Utop(λ) diagonalizes the Si(λ) of H(λ) simultane- ously. [For Si(λ), and hence Utop(λ), encoding topologi- cal order, Utop(λ) is not a local unitary.] We now analyze whether the eigenstate topological order can be diﬀerent for λ = λ′ − ǫ and λ = λ′ + ǫ. Since Utot(λ) is continuous, we have in the limit ǫ → 0  ˜U (λ′ − ǫ)Utop(λ′ − ǫ) = ˜U (λ′ + ǫ)Utop(λ′ + ǫ).  (8)  As ˜U (λ) is a local unitary, it cannot change the eigenstate topological order. Hence, Utop(λ′ − ǫ) and Utop(λ′ + ǫ) encode the same same eigenstate topological order, which is thus the same along the entire path λ ∈ [0, 1].  Next, we illustrate our tLIOMs on three examples, in-  cluding qubits and fermions in d = 1, 2, 3.  Disordered Kitaev chain (d = 1).– This is the spinless-  fermion Hamiltonian on an N -site open chain [40]  HK =  i 4  N −1  X  n=1  tn (cid:16)anan+1 + a†  n+1a†  n + h.c.(cid:17) ,  (9)  where an annihilates a fermion at site n and tn is Gaussian-random with mean zero and unit variance. In- troducing the Majorana operators  γ2n−1 =  1 2  (an + a†  n),  γ2n =  1 2  (−ian + ia†  n),  (10)  the Hamiltonian can be rewritten as  HK = i  N −1  X  n=1  tnγ2nγ2n+1.  (11)  Although it is a (non-interacting) commuting projector Hamiltonian (Sn = iγ2nγ2n+1), it fulﬁlls Deﬁnition 1 be- cause the localization of all eigenstates is stable as inter- actions are introduced [17]. It is also topological: The s-bits Sn (n = 1, . . . , N − 1), completed by Snl N = iγ2N γ1, cannot be connected to local fermion-product-state p- bits (−1)a† nan by any fermion-parity conserving local uni- tary [44]. (The same holds for a closed chain where SN is also local.) Here, fermion-parity is a protecting symmetry, although often taken as given in which case Eq. (11) is considered topologically ordered. For Eq. (11), the tLIOMs are Tn = Sn; upon adding weak disor- der (e.g., iPN n=1 µnγ2n−1γ2n with zero-mean Gaussian- random µn of much smaller than unit variance) they be- come Tn = ˜U Sn ˜U †, where ˜U is a parity-conserving local ˜U † unitary. In addition to Tn, the nonlocal T nl also appears in the expansion (5), but with magnitude exponentially suppressed in the linear system size L.  N = ˜U Snl  N  Disordered Toric code (d = 2).– We consider qubits on  the links of a square lattice on a torus and  Htc = −X  v  JvAv − X  p  KpBp,  (12)  i and Bp = Qi∈p σz  1,2 = Z1,2 = Qi∈C1,2 σz  where Av = Qi∈v σx i act on vertices v and plaquettes p of the lattice, respectively [39]. The couplings Jv and Kp are again Gaussian-random with mean 0 and variance 1. Eq. (12) is also a commuting projector Hamiltonian, but is expected to fall under Def- inition 1 because upon adding weak disorder, such as a randomly ﬂuctuating magnetic ﬁeld Pi hiσz i , the Hamil- tonian is believed to remain FMBL [15, 19]. The local s- bits are {Av}, {Bp}; they are completed by, e.g., the non- contractible Wilson loops Snl i on the two torus generating cycles C1,2. Hence s-bit strings specify topologically degenerate eigenspaces |{si}, z1, z2i with zi = ±1 the eigenvalue of Zi. Upon adding weak dis- order, tLIOMs become { ˜U Av ˜U †}, { ˜U Bp ˜U †}, where again ˜U is a local unitary. These are completed by the nonlocal integrals of motion, e.g., ˜U Zi ˜U †; as before, for ﬁnite lin- ear system size L these also appear in the expansion (5), but with exponentially suppressed coeﬃcient. The cor- responding ∝ exp(−L) splitting of topological degenera- cies is much larger than the level spacing ∝ exp(−L2), i.e., hard to detect in exact diagonalization [15, 17, 19]. As we noted earlier, our framework can avoid this prob- lem: it allows us to take advantage of the eﬃcient ap- proximation of ˜U by a quantum circuit Uqc, and em- ploy the methods of Refs. [8, 14] to numerically minimize Pi tr(cid:0)[H, Tqc,i][H, Tqc,i]†(cid:1) with Tqc,i = UqcSiU † qc. Thus obtaining Uqc gives the approximation of the tLIOMs Tqc,i, of their nonlocal completion T nl qc,i = UqcZiU † qc, and of the topological multiplets Uqc|{si}, z1, z2i. In addition to demonstrating these FMBL topological multiplets, the presence of FMBL topological order could be tested by comparing to minimizing with τqc,i = Uqcσz qc instead  i U †  4  of Tqc,i. If Tqc,i perform signiﬁcantly better, this would indicate that the system is in a topological FMBL phase. Disordered X-cube model (d = 3).– Fractons are ele- mentary excitations which either cannot move without creating additional fractons (at an energy cost) or other- wise only along certain directions [35–38]. Here, we focus on the so-called X-cube model [36] of qubits on the links of a cubic lattice on the 3-torus. The Hamiltonian is HX = −X  ucAc − X  v + K xz  v + K yz  v Bxy  v Bxz  v Byz  (K xy  v ) ,  c  v  (13)  i , Bµ  v = Qi∈v(µ) σz  where Ac = Qi∈c σx i with c denoting a cube and v(µ) the sites around vertex v lying par- allel to plane µ = xy, xz, yz. The couplings uc and K µ v are Gaussian-random with mean 0 and variance 1. This, again, is a commuting projector Hamiltonian, but may satisfy Deﬁnition 1 as fracton models may become FMBL [19]. The local s-bits are {Ac}, {Bµ v }. On a 3- torus of linear size L, they are completed by 6L − 3 independent noncontractible commuting Wilson loops Snl [37]. The subextensive scaling of the number of these i suggests that a tLIOM description may be useful, which proceeds analogously to the toric code case.  Conclusion.– The framework of tLIOMs and their non- local completions introduced here is naturally suited for describing topologically ordered FMBL systems. We used it to demonstrate a number of features, includ- ing Statements 1-4, and illustrated its concrete form on fermionic and qubit examples in d = 1, 2, 3. In closing, we mention a few examples of future directions where our framework may ﬁnd uses or generalizations. The l-bit de- scription gave crucial insights into the phenomenology of FMBL systems, including into the dynamics of quantum information [23]. A natural question is: what new fea- tures may arise in tLIOM-Hamiltonians (5) due to the topological order encoded in these? The suitability of our framework for tensor-network methods also opens the door for numerically addressing questions with at most heuristic answers thus far: under what conditions is FMBL present e.g., in the disordered toric code and what level of improvement may FMBL provide in pro- tecting the encoded quantum information? How do the conditions for FMBL depend on the type of Abelian topo- logical order beyond the toric code? How do tLIOMs behave near the topological MBL transition? FMBL is often invoked for protecting driven (Floquet) phases from heating [45]; our framework may thus ﬁnd applications in novel topologically ordered driven phases of matter. It would also be interesting to generalize our approach to symmetry-enriched topological phases [21] in the FMBL regime. The quantum circuit formalism of Ref. [46] might be of particular relevance for this endeavor.  We gratefully acknowledge support from the Euro- pean Commission through the ERC Starting Grant No. 678795 TopInSy.  Comm. 6, 7341 (2015).
