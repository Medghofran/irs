This release supersedes our ﬁrst data release from 2014, with a larger number of spectra (813 observations of 666 stars) and with a more extended wavelength coverage as the data from the near-infrared arm of the X-Shooter spectrograph are now included. The DR2 spectra then consist of three segments that were observed simultaneously and, if combined, cover the range between ∼300 nm and ∼2.45 µm at a spectral resolving power close to R = 10 000. The spectra were corrected for instrument transmission and telluric absorption, and they were also corrected for wavelength-dependent ﬂux-losses in 85% of the cases. On average, synthesized broad-band colors agree with those of the MILES library and of the combined IRTF and Extended IRTF libraries to within ∼1%. The scatter in these comparisons indicates typical errors on individual colors in the XSL of 2−4 %. The comparison with 2MASS point source photometry shows systematics of up to 5 % in some colors, which we attribute mostly to zero- point or transmission curve errors and a scatter that is consistent with the above uncertainty estimates. The ﬁnal spectra were corrected for radial velocity and are provided in the rest-frame (with wavelengths in air). The spectra cover a large range of spectral types and chemical compositions (with an emphasis on the red giant branch), which makes this library an asset when creating stellar population synthesis models or for the validation of near-ultraviolet to near-infrared theoretical stellar spectra across the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. Key words. stars – stellar libraries – data release  1. Introduction Stellar spectral libraries are fundamental resources that shape our understanding of stellar astrophysics and allow us to study the stellar populations of galaxies across the Universe. These libraries come in two ﬂavors: empirical, which are composed of a well-deﬁned set of stars with certain stellar atmospheric parameters coverage, and theoretical where stellar spectra are computed for an arbitrarily large set of parameters and exten- sive wavelength coverage. The list of empirical and theoretical spectral libraries grows continuously due to their versatile usage  (cid:63) Table C.1 and the spectra are available in electronic form at the CDS via anonymous ftp to cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr(130.79.128.5) or via http://cdsweb.u-strasbg.fr/cgi-bin/qcat?J/A+A/2019/ 36825 (cid:63)(cid:63) Based on observations collected at ESO Paranal La Silla Obser- vatory, Chile, Prog.

For the purpose of building stellar population synthesis mo- dels, a good stellar library should have four key properties, as highlighted by Trager (2012): an exhaustive coverage of all stel- lar evolutionary phases and chemical compositions to represent as well as possible the integrated light of real stellar systems; a broad wavelength coverage since not all stellar phases con- tribute equally at all wavelengths; simultaneous observations at all wavelengths to avoid issues due to temporal stellar spectral variations; and good calibration of the individual stars in terms of ﬂux and wavelength calibration as well as high-precision stel-  1 For an extensive list of stellar spectral libraries see David Montes’ web collection at https://webs.ucm.es/info/Astrof/invest/ actividad/spectra.html and references therein.

This latter point requires compari- son with synthetic stellar spectra, which highlights another im- portant application of libraries with the above properties: the va- lidation and improvement of theoretical stellar models across the Hertzsprung-Russell (HR) diagram and across wavelengths.  These were the goals of the X-Shooter Spectral Library (XSL), which is a moderate-resolution (R ∼ 10 000) spectral library that was designed to cover most of the HR diagram. The observations were carried out with the X-Shooter three-arm spectrograph on ESO’s VLT (Vernet et al. 2011) in two phases, a pilot and an ESO Large Program, spanning six semesters in to- tal. In our ﬁrst data release (Chen et al. 2014, hereafter DR1), we present spectra of 237 unique stars, which were observed during the pilot program, for a wavelength range that was restricted to the two optical arms of X-Shooter (300–1024 nm).  In the current data release (DR2), we present our full set of 813 observations of 666 stars, now also including data from the near-infrared arm of X-Shooter. This near-infrared exten- sion is undoubtedly one of the main advantages of XSL over other empirical spectral libraries in the literature. Empirical near- infrared libraries for a relatively wide range of stellar parame- ters have been constructed in the past, ﬁrst at very low spec- tral resolution (e.g., Johnson & Méndez 1970; Lançon & Rocca- Volmerange 1992), then progressively at intermediate resolution (e.g., Lançon & Wood 2000; Ivanov et al. 2004; Rayner et al. 2009; Villaume et al. 2017), or at higher spectral resolution but in restricted wavelength ranges (e.g., Cenarro et al. 2001; Ma- jewski et al. 2017). We note that some of these libraries did not attempt to preserve the shapes of the stellar continua across the wavelengths observed. Only some have been combined with op- tical libraries for the purpose of calculating the spectra of syn- thetic stellar populations (e.g., Pickles 1998; Lançon et al. 1999; Vazdekis et al. 2003; Maraston 2005; Lançon et al. 2008; Röck et al. 2016; Conroy et al. 2018). In these eﬀorts, the need to merge optical and near-infrared observations of distinct sam- ples of stars is an inevitable cause of systematic errors. The X- Shooter instrument helps alleviate this issue, as it acquires simul- taneous observations of the whole spectral range for every stellar target. In addition, the spectral resolution achieved is higher than those of any of the previous libraries that cover as broad spectral range.  The XSL DR2 data are homogeneously reduced and cali- brated, and the spectra are made available in three spectral ranges, corresponding to the three arms of the spectrograph: UVB - 300–556 nm, VIS - 533–1020 nm, and NIR - 994–2480 nm. Our data release contains, similar to DR1, repeated observa- tions of several cool giants stars. Both data releases are available on our website: http://xsl.astro.unistra.fr.  Our sample selection and observing strategy are described in Section 2. Section 3 gives details about the data reduction and calibration process. The ﬁnal spectra are assessed in terms of spectral resolution and energy distribution in Section 4. In Sec- tion 5, we summarize the data products made available, before concluding in Section 6. Additional details about the input cat- alogs used to build this library can be found in Appendix A. Appendix B collects peculiarities of some of the stars in the pro- gram, and observational artifacts that aﬀect some of the spectra. Finally, Appendix C provides the log of all the observations.

Selection criteria  The XSL target stars were selected to cover as much of the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram as possible in the allocated time, with a wide range of chemical compositions. Our original sam- ple consists of 679 unique stars. The primary references for the construction of the XSL target list were existing spectral libraries or compilations of stellar parameter measurements. In particular, the XSL sample has a strong overlap with the MILES spectral library (142 stars, Sánchez-Blázquez et al. 2006; Cenarro et al. 2007) and the NGSL library (135 stars, Gregg et al. 2006). We completed the list with objects from the parameter compilation PASTEL (Soubiran et al. 2010, 2016) and from a variety of more specialised catalogs (see Table A.1 in the Appendix for details and corresponding references). In Figure 1 we plot the distribu- tion of the selected XSL stars on the sky.  Fig. 1. Positions of XSL stars in the sky (Aitoﬀ projection).  More than half of the stars in the XSL library are red giants in the broad sense, which includes red supergiants or asymptotic gi- ant branch stars. These stars provide strong (age-dependent) con- tributions to the near-infrared emission of galaxies (e.g., Lançon et al. 1999; Maraston 2005; Melbourne et al. 2012). The lumi- nous red stars in XSL are located in star clusters, in the ﬁeld, in the Galactic bulge and in the Magellanic Clouds (Table A.1). A fraction of the asymptotic giant branch stars are carbon stars, whose spectra have been studied in detail by Gonneau et al. (2016, 2017). We obtained repeated observations for a fraction of the XSL stars (∼ 20% of our sample), mainly in the cases of luminous cool stars, known or suspected to vary in time.  Figure 2 presents the stellar atmospheric parameters cove- rage of the XSL sample as determined by Arentsen et al. (2019) and Gonneau et al. (2017). We refer the reader to Figure 2 of Chen et al. (2014) where the HR diagram is presented using literature values. Arentsen et al. (2019) estimated atmospheric parameters in a homogeneous manner for 754 XSL spectra of 616 stars: they ﬁt the ultraviolet and visible spectra with the ULySS package (Koleva et al. 2009) using the MILES spec- tral interpolator (Sharma et al. 2016) as a reference. Gonneau et al. (2017) determined atmospheric parameters of carbon-rich stars by comparing the observations to a set of high-resolution synthetic carbon star spectra, based on hydrostatic model atmo- spheres (Aringer et al. 2016)2 .  The aim of the selection was to obtain representative spectra mapping the widest area of the parameter space deﬁned by the eﬀective temperature (Teﬀ), the surface gravity (log g), and the  2 Only the stars less aﬀected by pulsation (namely stars from Groups A, B and C as deﬁned in Gonneau et al. 2017) are plotted in Fig. 2.  14h0h10hRA-75°-60°-45°-30°-15°0°15°30°45°60°75°DECAnaïs Gonneau et al.: The X-Shooter Spectral Library (XSL): Data Release 2  narrow-slit observation of the same target. In non-photometric conditions, as tolerated in our observations (“thin cirrus” tol- erance of the ESO VLT scheduling), absolute ﬂuxes cannot be garanteed, but the shape of the energy distribution is properly recovered with this method under the assumption that the cirrus have a ﬂat transmission curve4. We took wide-slit spectra for ev- ery target immediately after the narrow-slit ones, using a 5(cid:48)(cid:48)wide slit.  2.2.1. Observing mode  We performed our observations using the SLIT spectroscopy mode of X-Shooter. In this mode three observing strategies are available: STARE, NODDING, and OFFSET. We used each of them depending on the desired outcome. In STARE mode the star was located at the center of the slit and the sky background was estimated from each side of the stellar signal on the observed frame. We used this mode for the wide-slit observations.  The NODDING acquisition mode allows observations of the star at two positions (A and B) along the spectrograph slit. In this way we achieved an improved sky subtraction with a double- pass subtraction. Almost all our narrow-slit observations were taken in NODDING mode. An OFFSET acquisition mode alter- nates between the star and an empty sky region. We used this mode for 12 observations of very bright stars in the pilot pro- gram.  2.3. Spectro-photometric standard stars  In order to ﬂux-calibrate our science spectra we used spectro- photometric standard stars (typically white dwarf stars of type DA). These stars were observed once per night using a 5(cid:48)(cid:48)slit width.  In practice, we used only the ﬁve following stars, for which the spectral energy distribution and other parameters are given in the X-Shooter manual5: BD+17 4708, EG 274, Feige 110, LTT 3218, and LTT 7987. The other reference stars (CD-32 9927, EG 21, GD 153, GD 71, LTT 1020 and LTT 4364) were discarded either because their spectral energy distribution was not reliably known or because the long exposure times of their default observations (300 or 600 seconds) resulted in saturated NIR K-band spectra.  3. Data reduction and calibration We have reduced the full set of XSL observations over the pilot and the Large Programs in a uniform manner. This allows us to provide an updated calibration of the spectra initially released under DR1 and to ensure a homogeneity of the present DR2.  Our data reduction and calibration processes are illustrated in Fig. 3. We apply the ﬁrst four steps (referred to as “common data reduction”) to all observations: science target stars and ﬂux standards, wide and narrow slits, and all spectral arms. We use the X-Shooter data reduction pipeline (Modigliani et al. 2010, hereafter XSH pipeline, Sect. 3.1), up to the creation of two- dimensional (2D) order spectra. Then we extract 1-dimensional  4 Using the extinction curve for normal cirrus of Lynch & Mazuk (2001), we ﬁnd that the ratio of V-band to K-band transmission varies by less than 1 % when transmission drops from 100 % to 60 % because of standard cirrus. 5 http://www.eso.org/sci/facilities/paranal/ instruments/xshooter/tools/specphot_list.html  Article number, page 3 of 34  Fig. 2.

Therefore, the sample does not repro- duce the natural frequencies of various stellar types. At the time the target lists were prepared, large public catalogs of homoge- neous stellar parameter estimates were still lacking, and we were unable to populate certain regions of parameters in a satisfactory way. In particular, some of the Bulge stars selected on the basis of high estimated metallicities turned out to be less metal-rich than expected (Arentsen et al. 2019).  For applications requiring a higher level of completeness, we note that the X-Shooter instrument archive has become a useful source of complementary data over the years. Low mass dwarfs from the archive were combined with XSL data for population synthesis applications by Dries et al. (2019). The red supergiants of Davies et al. (2013) were observed with settings similar to XSL and can usefully complement the XSL library in that re- gion. Finally, the ESO archive3 contains a very large number of observations of B-type stars, because these have been used over many years for the correction of telluric absorption. We do not discuss these external data in this article.  2.2. Observing strategy We gathered the XSL observations in two phases: a pilot pro- gram (periods P84 and P85, October 2009 – September 2010) and a Large Program over four semesters (P89-P92, April 2012 – March 2014).  We observed each science target with two slit widths. We ﬁrst took a spectrum with a narrow slit to achieve the required spectral resolution. The narrow-slit widths for the UVB, VIS and NIR arms of X-Shooter were 0.5(cid:48)(cid:48), 0.7(cid:48)(cid:48), 0.6(cid:48)(cid:48), respectively, leading to nominal resolutions R = λ/∆λ ∼ 9200,∼ 11000 and ∼ 7770. With the narrow slits, a wavelength-dependent fraction of the stellar ﬂux is lost. The loss-fraction depends on the seeing, but also on the centering of the star in the slit and on the perfor- mance of the atmospheric dispersion corrector of the instrument, both of which are not controlled precisely. The most reliable ap- proach to correct these losses is to observe the targets with a wide slit positioned vertically on the sky. That observation can be calibrated into absolute ﬂux when conditions are photomet- ric and then can be used to correct the energy distribution of the  3 http://archive.eso.org/wdb/wdb/eso/xshooter/form  25005000100002000040000Teff [K]0123456log(g)Arentsen et al.

Saturation was a known problem for several observations of the pilot program but occurred rarely in later semesters. Here, we apply a scheme sim- ilar to that of DR1 to ﬂag strongly saturated observations auto- matically and exclude these from further processing.  We used the default parameters for the creation of the calibration frames (up to the xsh_ﬂexcomp recipe). To trans- form the science and ﬂux-standard frames into ﬂat-ﬁelded, rec- tiﬁed and wavelength-calibrated 2D order spectra, we used recipes xsh_scired_slit_stare for wide-slit observations, and xsh_scired_slit_oﬀset for narrow-slit observations. In particular, we reduced any frames observed in NODDING mode as if they were taken in OFFSET mode, which gives us more ﬂexibility in the handling of bad pixels and improves the quality of our ﬁnal spectra. In STARE mode, we switch oﬀ the sky-subtraction of- fered by the XSH pipeline because we apply our own algorithm during the subsequent 1D-extraction step. Two key parameters of the above recipes control the sampling of the output spectra along the wavelength axis and along the spatial axis. We set them respectively to 0.015 nm and 0.16(cid:48)(cid:48) for the UVB and VIS arms, and to 0.06 nm and 0.21(cid:48)(cid:48) for the NIR arm.  The ﬁnal products of the reduction with the X-Shooter pipeline are 2D frames containing the spectral orders of each arm. They include a map of pixel quality ﬂags and a map of the estimated variances of the pixel errors, which we use to propa- gate errors through subsequent processing steps.  Fig. 3. Overview of the XSL data reduction process.  3.2. 1D extraction  (1D) spectra outside of the XSH pipeline to better control the re- jection of bad pixels (see Sect. 3.2). We further apply corrections for the telluric absorption bands (Sect. 3.3) and for the continu- ous atmospheric extinction (Sect. 3.4).  After processing all observations in this uniform way, we de- rive response curves from the ﬂux-standard spectra (Sect. 3.5), and we use these to process both the narrow and wide slit sci- ence spectra (Sect. 3.5). Finally, using the wide-slit spectrum corresponding to each narrow slit observation, we derive a wave- length dependent ﬂux-loss correction and apply it to achieve the ﬁnal XSL spectrum for each stellar observation (Sect. 3.6).  3.1. XSH Pipeline The XSH pipeline consists of a set of data processing modules that perform the individual tasks of the data reduction. These “recipes” can be chained in a ﬂexible way to fulﬁll the require- ment of a speciﬁc program. We use the XSH pipeline version 2.6.8, in physical mode as per the pipeline recommendation. In that mode, the wavelength and spatial scale calibrations are per- formed by optimising a physical model of the instrument. To achieve a more ﬂexible automation of our process we run the XSH pipeline via the EsoReﬂex environment6 (version 3.12).  For each science observation, the input to the XSH pipeline is a set of raw data-frames that we identify and collect using the associations of calibration ﬁles provided by the ESO archive. When necessary, we modify the default associations to ensure that the ﬂux-standard frames are always reduced with the same ﬂat-ﬁeld as the corresponding science frames, rather than with  6 https://www.eso.org/sci/software/esoreflex/  Article number, page 4 of 34  A main driver for our choice of performing the extraction of 1D spectra outside of the XSH pipeline was the need for more con- trol over the rejection of bad pixels and the sky subtraction. Our extraction procedure follows a prescription adapted from Horne (1986). It implements a rejection of masked and outlier pixels, as well as a weighting scheme based on a smooth throughput proﬁle, that can follow residual distortions in the rectiﬁed 2D- spectra, and on the local pixel-variance as estimated by the ear- lier steps in the ESO pipeline. The extraction procedure is an updated version of the one presented in Gonneau et al. (2016), and the description below focuses on the modiﬁed elements.  3.2.1. Fraction of bad pixels  Before extracting a given order, we double-checked for satura- tion and other invalid pixels by counting the percentage of pixels ﬂaged as bad along the spectrum. The count is restricted to a box extending ±3 /±2 pixels (respectively for the UVB/VIS arms and the NIR arm) to either side of the peak of the spatial proﬁle of the spectrum. As a general rule, the extraction process is aban- doned if more than 30% of the pixels are determined to be bad. Exceptions are implemented for pixels with XSH pipeline-code 6 (unremoved cosmic ray), a warning that we discard to improve the extraction of the observations taken in exceptionally good seeing (see Section 3.2.5), and for XSH pipeline-code 21 (ex- trapolated ﬂux in the NIR) in the longest wavelength order of the NIR arm, because keeping those pixels was found to reduce discontinuities between the two last orders of that arm signif- icantly (this is an update with respect to Gonneau et al. 2016, who describe the discontinuities).

Sky background removal  We carried out a sky subtraction for all spectra acquired in STARE mode, as well as for any long-exposure VIS and NIR frames observed in NODDING and OFFSET modes (science frames with exposure times ≥ 600 s in the VIS and exposure time ≥ 200 s in the NIR; ﬂux standard frames with exposure time ≥ 190 s in the VIS and all the NIR frames). The areas along the slit from which the median sky levels are computed are selected in each frame after ﬁtting a Gaussian to the spatial proﬁle of the star, in order to account for the seeing. In STARE mode, these adjustments avoid artifacts such as the negative ﬂuxes that some- times result from over-subtraction in the standard XSH-pipeline process. In long-exposure spectra, the main purpose is to account for variations in the sky background between the two combined acquisitions.  3.2.3. Updated standard extraction  Horne’s extraction scheme relies on obtaining ﬁrst a rough guess for the 1D spectrum (that we refer to as the standard spectrum) and then optimizing this extraction with an inverse-variance weighted algorithm, that accounts for the spatial proﬁle of the light at a given wavelength (we call the result the ﬁnal spectrum). To obtain the standard spectrum, we summed the (sky- subtracted) 2D spectrum along the spatial dimension over a limited range of pixels. We updated our procedure by setting the limits to ± 4 or 8 pixels, respectively for NODDING and STARE/OFFSET frames, centered on the peak of the signal. The calculation of the ﬁnal spectrum is as in Gonneau et al. (2016). Along the spatial axis, the ratio of the ﬂux in a pixel to the nor- malized spatial proﬁle is taken as an estimate of the stellar ﬂux at the wavelength of interest and these estimates are averaged with an inverse-variance weight. A limited number of iterations are implemented to add outliers to the bad-pixel mask (maximum 3 at any wavelengths), and these pixels are discarded in the ﬁnal sum.  3.2.4. Merging of the individual orders  Figure 4 shows the overlapping orders before merging for each arm of the spectrograph. The ﬂat-ﬁelding algorithm of the XSH pipeline normalizes ﬂat-ﬁeld frames only globally, hence the blaze function of the instrument is removed in the division by the ﬂat-ﬁeld, and the extracted orders align well. To merge them, we combined the spectra in the regions of overlap, using weights that combine the inverse variance and a coeﬃcient, α, set to vary linearly from 0 to 1 across those regions. This choice was made because we found that the single-order variance was frequently underestimated at the very end of orders. Hence the ﬂux of each overlapping order, Fmerging, is calculated as follows:  Fmerging =  (1 − α) ∗ FL/VL + α ∗ FR/VR  ((1 − α)/VL + α/VR)  (1)  , where F and V stand for pixel ﬂuxes and variances, and sub- scripts L and R refer to the spectral orders on the left and right sides of region of overlap.  For the frames observed in NODDING mode, the 1D extrac- tion procedure produces two separate spectra that we averaged together. The end product of this procedure is a continuous 1D spectrum with two extensions: a ﬂux spectrum and an error spec- trum.  Fig. 4. Examples of order-by-order spectra for the three arms (XSL ob- servation X0365). From top to bottom: UVB (12 orders), VIS (15 or- ders) and NIR (16 orders).  3.2.5. Chessboard effect  Some of our NIR frames are aﬀected by an issue that we call the “chessboard eﬀect”. When the seeing is exceptional (typically < 2 pixels per FWHM of the spectral proﬁle in parts of the raw data), the interpolation scheme used by the XSH pipeline for the geometric transformation into a rectiﬁed, wavelength calibrated frame does not perform well. The resulting images (known as ORDER2D frames in the pipeline) display a chessboard pattern as illustrated in the top panel of Fig. 5. Because the wavy pat- terns seen along single lines of the rectiﬁed 2D-spectrum vary abruptly between one line and the next, the crests of these waves are mistaken for cosmic ray hits.  To deal with this, we ﬁrst identify pixels with bit code 6 in the quality-mask images produced by the XSH pipeline (ﬂag 6 = unremoved cosmic rays, cf. the bad pixel code conventions in the X-Shooter Pipeline Manual) and reset these ﬂags to “good pixel” 7 . Then, to avoid any re-ﬂagging by our own extraction procedure, we deﬁne a “safe zone” in the 2D frame in which any cosmic-ray identiﬁcation is switched oﬀ. This rectangular zone extends to ± 4 or 6 pixels on either side of the peak of the spatial proﬁle of the spectrum (respectively for NODDING or for STARE/OFFSET frames). This scheme was also used in a few VIS frames. The bottom panels of Fig. 5 show an example  7 A similar solution is now recommended by ESO on the X- Shooter FAQ webpage: http://www.eso.org/sci/data-processing/faq/ my-spectrum-of-a-bright-source-looks-much-noisier-than-i-expected-why. html  Article number, page 5 of 34  35004000450050005500Wavelength [Å]02000400060008000UVBExtracted, order by order, 1D spectra600070008000900010000Wavelength [Å]050001000015000VIS12000160002000024000Wavelength [Å]0200004000060000NIRA&A proofs: manuscript no. xsl_dr2  of a 2D quality-mask before and after editing, and the extent of the safe zone (represented as a blue rectangle).

The wavelength regions used for the ﬁtting procedure are speci- ﬁed in Table 2. For the NIR arm and the VIS arm, these regions are almost the same as those used in Kausch et al. (2015).  It is known that the wavelength calibration of X-Shooter is not perfect: Moehler (2015) reports shifts with an average peak-to-peak amplitude of 0.28 pixels, corresponding to 0.0042 nm and 0.0168 nm for our VIS and NIR data, respectively. This results in small oﬀsets between the wavelength scale of the spectrum and the synthetic telluric transmission spectrum produced by molecfit. We alleviate this problem by applying molecfit in a slightly diﬀerent way. First, we use the “classi-  Fig. 5. Example of ORDER2D frame aﬀected by the chessboard ef- fect.

Telluric absorption correction  We corrected the 1D extracted spectra for telluric absorp- tion with molecfit (Smette et al. 2015; Kausch et al. 2015). Molecfit uses a radiative transfer code and a molecular line database to calculate a synthetic spectrum of the Earth’s atmo- sphere based on local weather conditions and standard atmo- spheric proﬁles. In addition, molecfit also models the instru- mental line spread function. Once the characteristics of the in- strument have been taken into account, the synthetic transmis- sion spectrum can be used to correct an observed spectrum for telluric absorption.  Table 1 details the relevant parameters that we used for run- ning molecfit. Most of these are taken from Kausch et al. (2015), who also applied molecfit to the processing of X- Shooter spectra. In the UVB arm we only corrected for absorp- tion by O3, in the VIS arm we corrected for absorption by H2O, O2 and O3, and in the NIR arm for H2O, CO2, CO, CH4 and O2. Except for water vapor, the abundances of the diﬀerent mole- cular species are assumed to be constant and equal to the stan-  Article number, page 6 of 34  158001590016000161001620016300Spectral dimension [Å]0510152025Spatial dimensionINPUT 2D FLUX SPECTRUM (Order 16) for X0648158001590016000161001620016300Spectral dimension [Å]0510152025Spatial dimensionINPUT 2D QUALITY MASK158001590016000161001620016300Spectral dimension [Å]0510152025Spatial dimensionOPTIMAL 2D MASK158001600016200164001660016800Wavelength [Å]FluxStandard extraction (black) vs Final extraction [no flagging, no safe zone] (red)158001600016200164001660016800Wavelength [Å]FluxStandard extraction (black) vs Final extraction [flagging + safe zone] (red)Anaïs Gonneau et al.: The X-Shooter Spectral Library (XSL): Data Release 2  Fig. 7.

(2015), to derive the precipitable water vapor column (PWV). Then we cut the spectrum into diﬀerent wavelength segments. The seg- ments are chosen such that each one contains at least one telluric feature and, if possible, also a “clean” region which is (almost) free of telluric contamination. We ﬁx the PWV parameter to the value found in the ﬁrst iteration and apply molecfit to each of the wavelength segments. As a ﬁnal step, the corrected wave- length segments are recombined. Across regions where wave- length segments overlap, we use linearly progressive weights to average the two sets of data.  Our “extended molecfit” approach, where the spectrum of a particular arm is divided into smaller wavelength segments,  allows molecfit to ﬁnd better local wavelength solutions and line spread functions. The ﬁnal telluric-corrected spectra have a much smaller variance. We use the extended molecfit ap- proach to correct spectra in the VIS and NIR arms. The boun- daries of the diﬀerent wavelength segments are given in Table 3. Figure 7 compares the two telluric correction approaches: the classical molecfit approach (in gray) and the extended molecfit approach (in red). Figure 8 illustrates the results for the full VIS and NIR wavelength ranges. For the UVB arm, we use the classical molecfit approach since for this arm the wave- length region that contains telluric lines is relatively small.  3.4. Atmospheric extinction correction Before computing instrument response curves and applying them, the spectra of science and ﬂux-standard stars were cor- rected for observation-speciﬁc eﬀects. We corrected the frames for exposure time, gain and continuous atmospheric extinction as follows:  Fout =  Fin  exptime × gain  × 10(0.4·airmass·extinct)  (2)  , where Fin is the ﬂux of the observations as available after cor- rection for telluric absorption bands. The airmass, exposure time (exptime) and gain were taken from the observation header.  The atmospheric extinction (extinct, expressed in magni- tudes per unit airmass) combines aerosol scattering (Mie diﬀu- sion, kaero) and Rayleigh scattering (kray), following Patat et al. (2011).

Response curve and ﬁrst ﬂux calibration In the XSH pipeline the 2D ﬂat-ﬁeld spectra are not norma- lized across the surface of each grating order before they are divided into the program data. Hence the division corrects both the pixel-to-pixel variations of the sensitivity of the detector and major transmissions variations, such as those produced by the blaze functions of the gratings. This choice ensures that extracted single-order spectra within one arm are easily connectable. In exchange for this beneﬁt, the arm-spectra (as illustrated in Figs. 4 and 8) contain an imprint of the (inverted) spectra of the lamps used to illuminate the ﬂat-ﬁeld exposures. Unfortunately, the X-Shooter ﬂat-ﬁeld lamps are less stable than other elements of the acquisition chain, in particular in the NIR arm. Hence, when pairing observations of a science target and of a spectro- photometric standard star, it is recommended to use the same ﬂat-ﬁeld images for the two data sets8.  To determine a response curve from the 1D spectrum of a ﬂux standard, we performed a χ2-minimization between that ob- servation on one hand, and the product of its theoretical spec- trum and the unknown response curve on the other. The response curve is represented with a high-order spline polynomial. The typical number of spline nodes is 35 for the UVB and NIR  8 See XSHOOTER/qc/problems/problems_xshooter.html#NIR_FF; current recommendations extend to the VIS and UVB arms.  http://www.eso.org/observing/dfo/quality/  Fig. 8.

We model the aerosol contribution as advocated by Moehler et al. (2014): kaero = 0.014 × (λ[µm])−1.38 . The Rayleigh scattering mostly depends on the observation air- mass, and only weakly on the atmospheric conditions.

These spline nodes are not all regu- larly spaced; they are placed sparsely where spurious oscilla- tions should be avoided (e.g., across the telluric water bands in the NIR arm) and more tightly where small-scale instrumental eﬀects must be accounted for (e.g., features at 365 nm due to the combination of two diﬀerent ﬂat-ﬁelds in the UVB arm9, the dichroic features at 560-620 nm10, a ﬂat-ﬁeld bump at 2100 nm; see Moehler et al. 2014 for more details). Furthermore, we masked the Balmer lines in the UVB and VIS arms, the O2 lines in the VIS and the deepest telluric regions in the NIR.  We used the response curves for a ﬁrst ﬂux-calibration of the science spectra both for the narrow and wide slit observations. The resulting intensities are physical ﬂux densities, in erg s−1 cm−2 Å−1. These spectra are cleaned from the atmospheric and instrumental eﬀects, except for the slit losses. The narrow-slit spectra, in particular, still do not reﬂect the absolute distribution of the stellar ﬂux.  4.1. Typical signal-to-noise ratios Figure 11 shows the distribution of the median signal-to-noise ratios (S/Ns) per pixel for our observations. Except for the coolest stars, typical S/N values are about 70, 90 and 96 for the UVB, VIS and NIR arms respectively. In fact, the S/N for cool stars (Teﬀ < 5000 K) varies drastically with wavelength across the UVB arm. S/N similar to those of warmer stars are found in a temperature-dependent range of wavelength toward the red end of that arm.  Correlations between the errors in neighboring pixels are ex- pected as a result of the redistribution of pixel ﬂuxes when the original 2D-images are transformed into rectiﬁed order-images. They depend on the observation mode, on the seeing and on wavelength in a complex fashion. We have not attempted to cha- racterize them in detail. In general however, they would extend over a few pixels, on a wavelength range similar to the (arm- dependent) resolution element of the spectra.  3.6. Flux-loss correction and ﬁnal energy distributions  For 85% of the spectra, wide-slit observations of suﬃcient qua- lity are available, and thus the narrow-slit spectra are corrected for wavelength-dependent ﬂux-losses. To this end, we computed a smoothed version of the ratio of the wide-slit over the narrow- slit spectrum, and then ﬁt a low-order polynomial (typically of order 1 for UVB/VIS frames, and 3 for NIR frames). Finally, we multiplied our narrow-slit spectra by this polynomial. In a few cases (3 observations of 2 a priori non-variable stars, namely X0194 [HD 193281] and X0306/X0311 [HD 29391]), when only one of several observations of the same star had an associ- ated wide-slit spectrum or an otherwise more reliable continuum, that observation was used as a reference for the other observa- tion(s).  In summary, our data reduction procedure uses the ESO pipeline until the 2D spectra are rectiﬁed and wavelength- calibrated. Subsequent steps were adjusted, mainly to improve the usage of pixel-ﬂags, the sky subtraction, the telluric correc- tion and the combined usage of narrow-slit and broad-slit ob- servation for ﬂux calibration. 85 % of the DR2 spectra are ﬂux calibrated in the sense that they are corrected for all stable trans- mission factors of the acquisition chain, and for wavelength- dependent losses due to the narrow widths of the slits that pro- vide the desired spectral resolution. Residual ﬂux calibration errors may come from changes in telescope+instrument+sky transmission-curves between the observations of the science tar- gets and of the spectrophotometric standard star, and from resi- dual slit losses in the broad-slit observations. They are assessed via comparisons with external data sets in Section 4.5. A few examples of ﬁnal DR2 spectra can be found in Fig. 10.  4. Properties of the DR2 spectra  In this section we present an assessment of the overall properties of the spectra, including the quality of the wavelength and ﬂux calibration, and properties of the line-spread function. We de- scribe the quality ﬂags associated with each published spectrum.  https://www.eso.org/observing/dfo/quality/XSHOOTER/  9 pipeline/pipe_problems.html#uvb_flux 10 https://www.eso.org/sci/facilities/paranal/ instruments/xshooter/knownpb.html  4.2. Spectral resolution and line spread function We have determined the spectral resolution and the line spread function for each arm with the Penalized PiXel-Fitting method (pPXF , Cappellari & Emsellem 2004; Cappellari 2017), using a subset of the PHOENIX theoretical spectral library (Husser et al. 2013) as templates. The available PHOENIX library samples ef- fective temperatures with a step of 200 K (or of 500 K above 12000 K), surface gravities with a step of 0.5 dex, and [Fe/H] with a step of 0.5 dex (or of 1 dex where [Fe/H] < −1). The sub- set retained contains the 388 theoretical stars that are closest to the XSL library stars in the stellar parameter space, based on the stellar parameters derived from XSL observations by Arentsen et al. (2019).  All XSL UVB, VIS and NIR spectra were ﬁt one 200 Å- wide wavelength region at a time. In the NIR, the telluric- contaminated regions (13 500–14 200 Å and 17 700–21 000 Å) were not analyzed.  4.2.1. The spectral resolution The spectral resolution is described by the velocity dispersion measurements of the pPXF ﬁt, as the template spectrum has a much higher resolution (R ∼ 500 000, Husser et al. 2013) than the X-Shooter spectra (R ∼ 10 000). As the observations span multiple observing periods, the measurements for stars from dif- ferent observing periods were analyzed separately and then com- bined. In each observing period, the velocity dispersion results from the pPXF ﬁtting were sigma-clipped with a 5-σ threshold. Sigma-clipping was iterated until convergence was achieved.  Figure 12 shows the wavelength dependence of the resolu- tion for each observing period and X-Shooter arm. The 1 σ error bars belong to period P90 measurements, but are similar for all observing periods. The scatter around the median value comes from stars with lower S/N or a low number of spectral lines in each wavelength region. The red points show the weighted averages of the medians of all observing periods. The resolu- tion is stable throughout the observing periods, with only P84 observations showing slightly lower resolution. The resolution R = λ/∆λ is also relatively constant with wavelength, although Chen et al. (2014) initially showed otherwise for the UVB arm. However, they only used the F, G, K stars of observing periods P84 and P85. The adopted spectral resolution for each arm is the average value over all wavelengths: 13 ± 1 km s−1 for UVB, 11 ± 1 km s−1 for VIS, and 16 ± 1 km s−1 for NIR.

Rest-frame velocity correction  The DR2 data are corrected for radial velocity and provided in the rest-frame (with wavelengths in air). The barycentric ra- dial velocities, cz, were estimated separately in each of the three arms, because diﬀerences between arms are common and often in excess of 10 km s−1 (see Moehler 2015, for a discussion). The cz values are available in the header of the ﬁnal FITS ﬁles, to- gether with the barycentric corrections we applied12.  In the UVB and VIS arms, the ﬁnal estimates were ob- tained with the ULySS package (Koleva et al. 2009) and the ELODIE 3.2 spectral interpolator (Wu et al. 2011), as also used in the study of stellar parameters of Arentsen et al. (2019). This full-spectrum ﬁtting approach requires an approximate a priori knowledge of the radial velocity for the method to converge, because it performs a local minimization using a Levenberg- Marquardt algorithm. The accuracy of the cz guess should be better than a few times the FWHM of the spectral lines. At the resolution of XSL, the FWHM of the lines is on the order of 30 km s−1, and since the barycentric velocities of the Galactic and LMC/SMC XSL stars are expected to span a range of up to about 400 km s−1, we repeated the ﬁt starting with a series of cz guess in the interval from −300 to +300 km s−1 with a step of 100 km s−1. For each value of the guess, the atmospheric param- eters Teﬀ, log g and [Fe/H] as well as cz and the broadening were re-adjusted. The solution with the lowest χ2 was adopted.  In the NIR, the adopted values of cz were estimated by cross- correlation with the nearest model in the library of synthetic spectra of Husser et al. (2013). Starting from the estimated pa- rameters of Arentsen et al. (2019), we used χ2-minimization to identify an adequate near-IR representation of each near-infrared spectrum. The spectral ranges used for the cross-correlation were adjusted based on the eﬀective temperature and spectral type, in order to include a suﬃcient number of spectral features. In the coolest stars, we avoided regions dominated by a single steep molecular bandhead, as the resulting cz then depend on the way the spectra are renormalized to remove the dominant slope, be- fore the cross-correlation.  For some spectra of cool stars, it was not possible to deter- mine cz in the UVB, or even in the VIS, because of an insuﬃ- cient ﬂux. When a measurement in the NIR was available, we then simply assigned the latter to the UVB and VIS.  During the preparation of DR2, several methods other than those ﬁnally adopted were employed to re-estimate the radial velocities of various data subsets. The distributions of velocity diﬀerences between methods typically display an approximately Gaussian peak, with a standard deviation of 2 to 3 km s−1; non- Gaussian tails of the distributions typically contain ∼13%, ∼18% and ∼10% of the stars in the UVB, the VIS and the NIR arms. Hence the value of 2 to 3 km s−1 is representative of the uncer- tainties on the rest-frame wavelengths of the DR2 data.  4.4. Quality assurance  After the data reduction, we assigned a number of quality ﬂags to our data based on visual inspection and on experience gained by comparing the observations with synthetic or other empirical spectra (e.g., Gonneau et al. 2017; Lançon et al. 2018; Arentsen et al. 2019). Table 8 (item “Quality ﬂags (per arm)”) describes our ﬂags. The ﬂags were added to the headers of the ﬁnal FITS ﬁles, and peculiarities speciﬁc to individual spectra are listed in  12 The barycentric radial velocity is the sum of the topocentric velocity and the barycentric correction.

The shape of the line spread function  The deviations of the line spread function (LSF) from a Gaussian are described with Gauss-Hermite velocity moments h3 and h4, which are related to skewness and kurtosis respectively. These moments can be obtained with pPXF only when the signal-to- noise ratio is excellent. Therefore, h3 and h4 measurements from all observing periods were analyzed together. We computed the S/N in each wavelength bin (window of 200 Å each) and rejected measurements from spectra with S/N < 200. Additionally, mea- surements from the very blue wavelengths, λ < 3600 Å, were not included due to low signal. The Gauss-Hermite moments were ﬁ- nally computed from 6510 highest-quality pPXF measurements. Table 5 shows the median and the standard deviation of the re- sults per arm. To within one standard deviation, the line spread function in all arms is a Gaussian.  Table 5.

We note that this list is not exhaustive, as some arti- facts might have been overlooked.  More generic caveats concerning the data are the following. In the UVB, the spectra tend to be wavy near 0.35µm (the combi- nation of two diﬀerent ﬂat-ﬁelds D2 and QTH in this range leads to errors, see footnote 9) and between 0.545 – 0.55µm (known instabilities of the transmission of the dichroic plate that feeds the UVB and VIS arms of X-Shooter, see footnote 10).  For the VIS arm, frequent artifacts are seen in the spectral shape between 0.54 – 0.59µm (dichroic issue, see footnote 10). The continuum at the red end, beyond 0.97µm, can also have some artifacts (second dichroic region; eﬀect > 5 %). Molecﬁt corrects only for molecular absorption lines, hence telluric ab- sorption by metals is not removed (an example is the frequent contamination of the stellar NaI doublet by telluric Na, between 588 and 592 nm).  In the NIR, a step sometimes arises between the two reddest orders (near 2.25µm). The noise spectrum does not capture the 1.1µm telluric band suﬃciently strongly. The slope of the spec- trum is sometimes poorly determined below 1.05µm (dichroic region; eﬀect > 5 %). The K−band is usually of poor quality for hot stars (K-band contiuum wavy, lower S/N). Some of these stars are ﬂagged with HAIR_NIR (meaning that there are some narrow spikes in the NIR spectrum, cf Table 8).  4.5. Photometric comparison  Chen et al. (2014) compared the DR1 (UVB and VIS) spectra with literature spectra taken from NGSL (Gregg et al. 2006), the calcium-triplet library CaT (Cenarro et al. 2001), and also with higher-resolution spectral libraries such as UVES POP (Bagnulo  Article number, page 12 of 34  et al. 2003) and ELODIE (Prugniel & Soubiran 2001). They found a good agreement in the line shapes and depths between XSL and these libraries.  Here we focus on the broad-band spectral energy distribu- tion across the single-arm spectra of DR2. Based on synthetic photometry, we compare colors within the UVB and VIS arms to those of the MILES library (Sánchez-Blázquez et al. 2006); in the near-infrared, we confront the XSL colors with those of the 2MASS survey (Cohen et al. 2003; Skrutskie et al. 2006), and with synthetic colors of the IRTF/E-IRTF spectra (Rayner et al. 2009; Villaume et al. 2017).  4.5.1. Comparison with MILES  Many of the XSL stars were initially selected from the MILES collection (Sánchez-Blázquez et al. 2006). Forty MILES stars were present in XSL DR1, and Chen et al. (2014) found a good agreement between these data in the UVB and VIS arms. In the present release, 173 spectra of 142 stars have a MILES counter- part, of which 164 are corrected for slit-losses. To avoid com- plications due to the edges of the X-Shooter arms, we deﬁne artiﬁcial broad-band ﬁlters to compare the synthetic photometry of the two data sets (Table 6 and Figure 13).  Figure 14 shows how the MILES and XSL synthetic colors compare. We ﬁnd excellent agreement in general, with a mean oﬀset of −0.005/ − 0.01 mag and an rms scatter of 0.056/0.032 mag, respectively for colors (box1 − box2) and (box3 − box4). We have examined outliers with color diﬀerences larger than 0.1 mag individually, using plots of the spectra and the extensive comparison of XSL spectra with the theoretical spectra of Husser et al. (2013) that is the subject of another article (in prep.).

We observed this star at a diﬀerent phase than MILES. The star is also an outlier in (box1 − box2). Six other outliers at the red end of (box1 − box2) are cluster stars. Five of these are in NGC 6838. We trust their XSL energy distributions to bet- ter than 10 % because the comparison of these spectra with red- dened theoretical models raises no alarms and leads to an ex- tinction estimate that agrees with the values listed in Di Cecco et al. (2015) for the cluster (article in preparation). One object is in NGC 1904, and again best-ﬁt models are not alarming and agree with the very small reddening toward that cluster found in the literature. Still in (box1 − box2), the bluest outlier is a hot star, which is also represented very well with models. Removing those outliers, the rms scatter in (box1− box2) drops from 0.056 to 0.030 mag. The two outliers in (box3−box4) not yet discussed are the hot star just mentioned, and an F-type star for which the ﬁt with model spectra excludes large error on the slope in the VIS arm. Removing these, the rms scatter for (box3 − box4) drops from 0.032 to 0.022 mag. Table 7 summarizes these dispersion measurements.  4.5.2. Comparison with 2MASS  The 2MASS ﬁlters J, H and Ks ﬁt entirely into the wavelength range of the NIR arm of X-Shooter, as seen in Figure 15. We compute synthetic photometry compatible with 2MASS using the relative spectral response curves and reference ﬂuxes of Co- hen et al. (2003). The 2MASS ﬁlters J, H and Ks ﬁt entirely into the wavelength range of the NIR arm of X-Shooter, as seen in Figure 15).  Figure 16 shows the results of the comparison. Overall there is good agreement. Small systematic oﬀsets indicate small zero point errors in the exercise; they are in opposite directions for (J − H) and (H − Ks), suggesting a normalization diﬀerence in  Fig. 14.

These are still conservative estimates of the errors in the near-infrared XSL colors, which are clariﬁed in Section 4.5.3. In both panels, the larger dispersion toward redder objects is due to cool stars (M and C stars, and stars with Teﬀ < 3500K), of which many are known or suspected variables.  4.5.3. Comparison with IRTF  Empirical near-infrared spectral libraries are still rare in the lite- rature. We choose to compare XSL with the IRTF spectral library (Rayner et al. 2009) and its later extension (hereafter E-IRTF, Villaume et al. 2017) as their wavelength range overlaps with ours (0.7 – 2.5 µm) and the spectra are ﬂux-calibrated. Their resolution is R ∼ 2000, and their signal-to-noise ratios are on the order of 100. IRTF contains mainly solar-metallicity stars with spectral types between F and M, plus some AGB stars and L dwarfs. E-IRTF extends the metallicity coverage of IRTF for late-type stars from mainly solar to −1.7 < [Fe/H] < 0.3. Our sample counts 19 stars in common with IRTF (in practice 25 XSL spectra) and 48 stars in common with E-IRTF (61 XSL spectra), The cross-match between XSL and IRTF then corre- sponds to 86 spectra in total, and 77 when we restrict the sample to XSL spectra with slit-loss corrections.  Figure 17 shows the comparison. We ﬁnd a good agreement with insigniﬁcant oﬀsets ((cid:54) 0.007 mag) and an initial rms scatter of 0.033 and 0.029 mag, respectively for (J−H) and (H−Ks). We checked all the outliers individually (respectively 6 and 4 cases for these two colors), by overplotting the IRTF and XSL spec- tra on one hand, and by inspecting the comparison of the XSL spectra with best-ﬁt stellar models on the other. One outlier is a Mira that indeed varied in spectral type between the observa- tions. Another is a star listed as abnormal in Table B.1 (X0878). For all other cases, the IRTF SEDs show signs of a discontinuity between the J and the H band, while the comparison between the XSL and the theoretical spectra essentially excludes errors larger than a few percent. Removing the 6 suspicious cases from the sample, the scatter drops to 0.023 mag in (J − H) and 0.019 mag in (H − Ks). Hence a representative value of our internal uncer- tainties in these near-infrared colors, at least for this subsample, is 2 %.  Article number, page 14 of 34  Fig. 16. Comparison of synthetic colors between XSL and 2MASS. Only XSL-spectra with slit-loss corrections are used. The brown points correspond to cool stars (Teﬀ < 3500 K or spectral type M and C. The legends provide the average oﬀset between the colors of the two data sets, the rms scatter around the mean, as well as the part of the rms scatter that is explained by the 2MASS error bars shown in the bottom panels.).  5. Final data products and availability  The ﬁnal data products released as DR2 consist of single-arms spectra, with linearly sampled wavelengths in the rest-frame. The spectra are provided as FITS binary tables, each contain- ing three columns: the wavelength (in nm), the ﬂux spectrum (in erg s−1 cm−2 Å−1), and an error spectrum (in the same units). A set of keywords in the headers of the FITS ﬁles keep track of various steps of the data-reduction and calibration processes, and of results of the quality assessments. A (non-exhaustive) list of these keywords is given in Table 8.  The DR2 spectra are made available as two separate sets. The ﬁrst contains those spectra for which a correction for ﬂux- losses across the spectrograph slit was possible, as described in Section 3.6). It represents 85 % of the observations. We choose to also deliver the remaining 15% of the spectra, for which the ﬂux- losses could not be estimated and corrected. They are identiﬁed  Anaïs Gonneau et al.: The X-Shooter Spectral Library (XSL): Data Release 2  Table 8. XSL keywords dictionary (primary header).

(2014), we release 246 near-ultraviolet and vis- ible spectra for 237 stars. In this paper, we present the second data release of the X-Shooter Spectral Library, which consists of all the spectra observed as part of this Large Program, in all the three wavelength ranges of the instrument. The major addi- tion of this release is the near-infrared data, which extends out to 2.5 µm. The simultaneous optical and near-infrared observa- tions in this unique dataset eliminate a major risk of inconsisten- cies that has prevailed in previous empirical multi-wavelength libraries based on independent samples in the two wavelength regions. The library contains 2 388 spectra of 666 unique stars, at a resolution R ∼ 10 000. This corresponds to 791 UVB spec- tra, 811 VIS spectra and 786 NIR spectra of these stars.  All the spectra, including those previously released, have been reduced in a homogeneous way with updated algorithms. They were corrected for atmospheric extinction and telluric ab- sorption, which maximizes the wavelength ranges suitable for  scientiﬁc exploitation. In particular, the wings of the water bands of the atmospheres of cool stars in the NIR arm can be measured, and synthetic photometry can be exploited across wavelength re- gions where it would otherwise be close to meaningless.  The observational setup and the data reduction were tailored to achieve a good relative ﬂux calibration of the spectra, prior- itizing the energy distributions over absolute ﬂuxes. This eﬀort was driven by two main scientiﬁc applications foreseen for XSL. In population synthesis calculations, the energy distributions are important in determining the relative ﬂuxes of various stars at diﬀerent wavelengths. They are also relevant if the data are used to test how well current theoretical stellar models are able to reproduce observed colors and spectral features simultaneously. Flux calibration is notoriously diﬃcult to achieve with slit-fed echelle spectrographs and X-Shooter is no exception. 85 % of the DR2 spectra are ﬂux calibrated in the sense that they are cor- rected for all stable transmission factors of the acquisition chain, and for wavelength-dependent losses due to the narrow widths of the slits that ensured the desired spectral resolution. For these 85 %, residual ﬂux calibration errors may come from changes in telescope+instrument+sky transmission curves between the ob- servations of the science targets and of the spectrophotometric standard star, and from residual slit losses in broad-slit observa-  Article number, page 15 of 34  A&A proofs: manuscript no. xsl_dr2  pending on additional observations with other instruments (e.g., the integral-ﬁeld spectrograph MUSE, as suggested by Ivanov et al. 2019).  The residual errors in the relative ﬂux scales of the spec- tra of the three arms of X-Shooter are generally smaller than a few percent. However, there are exceptions, and merging the arms for all the DR2 spectra is a non-trivial process. As previ- ously mentioned, simply ﬁtting the observations to (adequately reddened) theoretical spectra does not provide immediately use- ful re-scaling factors, as available collections of models do not match the observed energy distributions suﬃciently well in all parts of the HR diagram (again, the systematics in these trends show that the issues are not artifacts of ﬂux calibration proce- dures). Work on merging the arm-spectra is ongoing (Verro et al. 2019). This work is tied to the development of a spectral inter- polator for XSL, which is needed to predict XSL-based spectra along the isochrones of artiﬁcial stellar populations. The com- parison between interpolated and original library spectra helps identifying and correcting merged spectra for which the initial relative scaling is inadequate.  The DR2 spectra are made available in the restframe, with radial velocity information in the headers. While the restframe calibration is accurate to typically better than 2 km/s, the radial velocity estimates are aﬀected by larger instrumental instabilities and should be regarded with caution.  Because XSL extends into the near-infrared, it emphasises cool and infrared-luminous stars which otherwise tend to be scarce in stellar libraries. Studying the AGB stars and red su- pergiants by themselves will help reduce current discrepancies with synthetic spectra based on static and dynamical stellar at- mosphere models (e.g., Lançon et al. 2018), and will contribute to our understanding of young and intermediate age stellar pop- ulations. However, XSL remains a general-purpose library that covers a wide range of stellar types and chemical compositions. Fundamental stellar parameters have already been determined and published (Arentsen et al. 2019). We expect XSL will serve a diversity of projects, and in particular improve stellar popula- tion synthesis models at a time where many observing facilities concentrate on oﬀering near-infrared instrumentation.

The remaining 15 % of the DR2 spectra are not corrected for slit-losss, because the matching broad-slit observations were faulty. Systematic diﬀerences of the energy distributions with those of previous libraries, if any, are small: the average dif- ferences between the synthetic colors measured on XSL spectra (after slit-loss correction) and on spectra from Miles or (E-)IRTF are below 1 %; the dispersion in these comparisons indicates typical individual errors on these broad-band colors, outside the main telluric regions, of 2 to 4 % in XSL (with some outliers). Anticipating future publications, we note that comparisons with theoretical spectral libraries across the HR-diagram show clear systematic diﬀerences that depend on location in that diagram, with excellent matches in some regions and oﬀsets in certain col- ors in others; this demonstrates that the current ﬂux calibration allows us to address the scientiﬁc questions that were planned. We note that it may be possible to improve the spectrophotome- try of XSL spectra in the future, at least at optical wavelengths,  Article number, page 16 of 34  Anaïs Gonneau et al.: The X-Shooter Spectral Library (XSL): Data Release 2  Arentsen, A., Prugniel, P., Gonneau, A., et al. 2019, A&A, 627, A138  Aringer, B., Girardi, L., Nowotny, W., Marigo, P., & Bressan, A. 2016, MNRAS,  457, 3611  Arp, H. 1965, ApJ, 141, 43  Bagnulo, S., Jehin, E., Ledoux, C., et al. 2003, The Messenger, 114, 10  Bergeat, J., Knapik, A., & Rutily, B. 2002, A&A, 390, 967  Blanco, V.
