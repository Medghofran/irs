R. China.  Cosmological models describing the non-gravitational interaction between dark matter and dark energy are based on some phenomenological choices of the interaction rates between dark matter and dark energy. There is no such guiding rule to select such rates of interaction. In the present work we show that various phenomenological models of the interaction rates might have a strong ﬁeld theoretical ground. We explicitly derive several well known interaction functions between dark matter and dark energy under some special conditions and ﬁnally constrain them using the latest cosmic microwave background observations from ﬁnal Planck legacy release together with baryon acoustic oscillations distance measurements. Our analyses report that one of the interacting functions is able to alleviate the H0 tension. We also perform a Bayesian evidence analyses for all the models with reference to the ΛCDM model. From the Bayesian evidence analyses, although the reference scenario is preferred over the interacting scenarios, however, we found that two interacting models are close to the reference ΛCDM model.

INTRODUCTION  Observational evidences from various astronomical sources suggest that a non-zero interaction in the dark sectors, i.e., between dark matter (DM) and dark en- ergy (DE) is allowed [1, 2], and consequently, a mild deviation from the non-interacting Λ-cosmology is ex- pected. Although within 1σ conﬁdence level one may recover ΛCDM model, but however, the null-interaction is not yet conﬁrmed. The question arises why should we consider the interaction between DM and DE? The an- swer could be given in diﬀerent ways. Since the nature and evolution of DM and DE are not known to us then there is no justiﬁcation to avoid the possibility of mutual interaction between these dark sectors. In fact, the inter- action in the dark sector is a promising approach which solves the coincidence problem [3, 4, 5, 6, 7] and it was motivated to solve the cosmological constant problem [8]. Investigations by several investigators in the last couple of years explored some more interesting properties of the interacting DE models [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50]. It has been shown that the interaction between DM and DE can solve the tension on the present Hubble constant value, H0, appearing from its local and global measure- ments [51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56] and also the tension in the amplitude of the matter power spectrum, σ8, by dif- ferent observations [55, 57, 58]. However, although the models in such theory are phenomenologically motivated,  ∗Electronic address: supriya.maths@presiuniv.ac.in †Electronic address: Sharov.GS@tversu.ru ‡Electronic address: d11102004@163.com  but nevertheless, from the particle physics point of view, the interaction between DM and DE is a natural phe- nomenon because any two ﬁelds (DM ﬁeld and DE ﬁeld) can interact with each other. In the last several years, several people have studied the DM and DE dynamics with diﬀerent choices for the interaction function relat- ing the energy densities of the dark sectors. Depending on the choice of the function, the interaction becomes linear or non-linear in the energy densities of the dark sectors.  Mathematically and physically as well, we have no rigid theoretical bounds for the mentioned interaction func- tions. If the universe contains n matter components with the energy momentum tensors T i µν, i = 1, . . . , n, such that either all or some of the energy components interact with each other, then the energy conservation condition  n(cid:88)  i=1  ∇µ  T i µν = 0  is fulﬁlled only for all matter, but not for every i-th com- ponent. So we can add and subtract any interaction func- tion Qν ≡ Qij  ν for i-th and j-th components: µν = −Qν. ∇µT i  µν = Qν,  ∇µT j  (1)  The investigators mentioned earlier (see again [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 40, 41, 42, 43]) worked with diﬀerent phenomenological variants of the interaction function Q. In particular, in the interactive models [3, 8, 59, 60, 61] the DE compo- nent was described as a scalar ﬁeld φ, that takes part in the phenomenologically constructed interaction with the standard cold DM (an ideal ﬂuid with zero pressure).  In this paper we suggest a variant of motivation to consider the interaction term Q in diﬀerent linear and  non-linear forms. Our approach includes a symmetric description of both DM and DE as two scalar ﬁelds φ1 and φ2, where they may interact via their common po- tential V (φ1, φ2). It is widely known that scalar ﬁelds can simulate cosmological evolution (see reviews [62, 63]). Models with two scalar ﬁelds were suggested and studied in Refs. [64, 65, 66, 67, 68], however, the authors’ inter- est was not concentrated on the possibilities to describe interaction of dark components.  In this approach we suppose, that the interaction func- tion Q can be deduced from the (more fundamental) po- tential V (φ1, φ2). The connection between V and Q is rather complicated in general, in particular, the linear dependence of Q on densities (the linear interaction) is not the most obvious result of this approach. In any case we have a degree of freedom on a certain level: when we choose the potential V , or the interaction term Q.  We organize the work as follows. In section 2, we give the details of the mathematical formulation of an inter- acting universe and describe, how diﬀerent forms of the interaction function Q can be deduced from the common potential of scalar ﬁelds. In section 4, we list the ob- servational data to analyse the models and consequently present the results of various observational analyses. Fi- nally, we summarize the main ﬁndings of the work in section 5.  2.  INTERACTING DARK ENERGY: A FIELD  THEORETIC DESCRIPTION  We consider a cosmological scenario where two heavy dark ﬂuids in the universe, namely, the DM and DE non- gravitationally interact with other. The other compo- nents, namely the baryons and radiation do not take part in the interaction. To describe such interacting universe, as usual we assume the homogeneous and isotropic Friedmann-Lemaˆıtre-Robertson-Walker line el- ement given by  (cid:20) dr2 1 − κr2 + r2(cid:0)dθ2 + sin2 θdφ2(cid:1)(cid:21)  .(2)  ds2 = −dt2 + a2(t)  Here, a(t) is the scale factor of this FLRW universe and κ is the curvature sign of the universe. The curvature sign may describe three diﬀerent geometries of the universe, namely, ﬂat (κ = 0), open (κ = −1) and closed (κ = 1). Since most of the observational estimations prefer a ﬂat geometry of the universe, see for instance [69, 70], henceforth, we ﬁx the spatial ﬂatness of the universe in this work. Thus, in such a prescribed geometric structure of the universe one can write down the Einstein’s ﬁeld equations as  H 2 =  8πG  3  ˙H = −4πG  ρi,  (pi + ρi),  (3)  (4)  (cid:88) (cid:88)  i  i  2  where an overhead dot in any quantity denotes its cosmic time diﬀerentiation; H ≡ ˙a/a is the Hubble rate of this FLRW universe; (ρi, pi) respectively refer to the energy density and pressure of the i-th ﬂuid. Precisely, ρr, ρb, ρc, ρx are respectively the energy densities of radiation, baryons, DM and a DE ﬂuid. Similarly, pr, pb, pc and px are respectively the pressure components of radiation, baryons, DM and DE. Since radiation and baryons do not take part in the interaction, thus they follow the standard evolution equations while the conservation equations of the interacting DM and DE follow,  ˙ρc + 3H(ρc + pc) = −Q, ˙ρx + 3H(ρx + px) = Q.  (5) (6)  Below we will assume that DM is the cold DM (or, pres- sureless DM), and thus, pc = 0. The interactive term Q in Eqs. (5), (6) is usually factorized by the Hubble rate H and can depend on the densities ρc, ρx, pres- sures pc, px, other parameters [3, 8, 59, 60, 61] (see also the classiﬁcation in Ref. [1]). We can choose a function Q(H, ρc, ρx, . . . ) in many variants: diﬀerent possibilities of this choice and a more fundamental approach to de- duce Q may be illustrated in the following scheme.  We generalize the traditional scalar ﬁeld simulation of DE [3, 8, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63] and suppose that both DM and DE ﬂuids are described correspondingly as two real scalar ﬁelds φ1 and φ2. Their interaction is naturally managed by a common potential V (φ1, φ2) in the action [64, 65, 66, 67]  (cid:90)  √−g  d4x  S =  (cid:34)  R  16πG  − 1 2  (∇φ1)2 − 2 2  (∇φ2)2  (cid:35)  −V (φ1, φ2)  + Sm.  (7)  Here, R = gµνRµν is the Ricci scalar, the factors j = ±1 determine quintessential or phantom nature of a ﬁeld, (∇φj)2 = gµν∂µφj∂νφj, the term Sm describes the re- maining matter (baryons, radiation).  The action (7) is symmetric with respect to DM φ1 and DE φ2. This form is convenient to generate an interaction of these ﬂuids, however, it does not coincide with the widely used approach [3, 8, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63], where a scalar ﬁeld φ describes only the DE. For DM one can ﬁnd some form of a scalar ﬁeld description in mimetic models [71, 72] (also see [73, 74, 75, 76, 77]), but in the action (7) the ﬁeld φ1 is not connected with conformal degrees of freedom of any auxiliary metric.  If we vary the action (7) over gµν, φ1 and φ2, we deduce  the dynamical equations  Rµν − R 2  gµν = 8πG  (cid:34) 2(cid:88)  j=1  (cid:16)  j  ∂µφj∂νφj − 1 2  (∇φj)2gµν  (cid:17) (cid:35)  −V gµν + T m  µν  ,(8)  ∇µ∇µφj = j  ∂V ∂φj  ,  j = 1, 2.(9)  The covariant divergence of the equation (8) leads to the energy conservation equation ∇µT m µν = 0 for baryons and radiation, because the terms with φj vanish as the con- sequence of Eqs. (9).  For the FLRW universe (2) in its ﬂat case κ = 0 the equations (8) may be reduced to the form (3), (4), but with the following new content of the total density and pressure:  ρtot =  ptot =  1 2 1 2  ˙φ2 1 +  ˙φ2 1 +  2 2 2 2  ˙φ2 2 + V (φ1, φ2) + ρb + ρr, 2 − V (φ1, φ2) + pb + pr. ˙φ2  (10)  The scalar ﬁeld equations (9) for the FLRW universe  (2) take the similar form  ¨φ1 + 3H ˙φ1 = −1 ¨φ2 + 3H ˙φ2 = −2  ∂V ∂φ1 ∂V ∂φ2  ,  ,  (11)  (12)  but they describe interaction of the ﬂuids φ1 and φ2, if the potential V (φ1, φ2) is not equal to a sum V1(φ1) + V2(φ2).  This interaction between φ1 and φ2 can be rewritten and represented in the form (5), (6), if we divide the common potential V (φ1, φ2) into two parts (introducing an additional degree of freedom with this division)  V (φ1, φ2) = V1(φ1, φ2) + V2(φ1, φ2)  (13)  and determine the densities and pressures of the dark components:  ρ1 =  ρ2 =  1 2 2 2  ˙φ2 1 + V1,  p1 =  ˙φ2 2 + V2,  p2 =  1 − V1, ˙φ2 2 − V2 . ˙φ2  1 2 2 2  In these notations the dynamical equations (11), (12)  for 2 scalar ﬁelds will take the form (5), (6):  ˙ρ1 + 3H(ρ1 + p1) = −Q, ˙ρ2 + 3H(ρ2 + p2) = Q,  with the interacting term  Q = ˙φ1  ∂V2 ∂φ1  − ˙φ2  ∂V1 ∂φ2  .  3  Obviously, this interaction term Q equals zero in the  case of non-interacting decomposing potential [68]  V (φ1, φ2) = V1(φ1) + V2(φ2).  (17)  In the general case (13) we have the mentioned degree of freedom, when V is divided into V1 and V2. However, this degree of freedom is a form of gauge transformations and does not change the model behavior: if we redeﬁne V1 to ˜V1 = V1 + δV (φ1, φ2) (and V2 → ˜V2 = V2 − δV ), we will obtain the correspondent redeﬁnition of ρ1 and Q, in particular, Q → ˜Q = Q − d dt δV . But the dynamical equations (3), (11), (12) and observable manifestations will remain just the same.  The most surprising point in the considered model (7) is its description of the cold DM (an ideal ﬂuid with zero pressure) as the scalar ﬁeld φ1. However, it is possible, if we, naturally, ﬁx the sign 1 = 1 and require zero value for the pressure p1 (14):  1 = 1,  p1 ≡ 1 2  1 − V1(φ1, φ2) = 0. ˙φ2  (18)  In particular, this model without the DE ﬁeld (φ2 = 0, V2 = 0) under the condition (18) recovers the Friedmann solution a = (t/t0)2/3 with the following exponential po- tential:  V1(φ1) ≡ V (φ1) = A exp(cid:0) − 2  6πG φ1  (cid:1),  √  φ1 =  log t√ 6πG  + const.  (19)  The ΛCDM model will be reproduced, if for the non- interacting case (17) we impose the conditions (18), φ2 = 0, V2 = const, and obtain  φ2 = 0,  V2 =  Λ  = const,  8πG  6πG (φ1 − φ0)(cid:3) sinh2(cid:2)√ −2(cid:2)√ 3Λ (t − t0)(cid:3).  sinh  (20)  (21)  V1(φ1) =  Λ  16πG Λ  =  16πG  Here, φ0, t0 are constants of integration.  Another solution for two interacting scalar ﬁelds was obtained in Ref. [65], it describes the Big Rip singularity (at t = ts) with the Hubble parameter, ﬁelds  (cid:19)  (cid:18) 1  t  (cid:34)  (14)  H =  θ 3  1 t − ts + ts − t , t0  , φ1 = φ0 log  2 = −1  t t0  ,  (22)  φ2 = φ0 log  and the potential  V (φ1, φ2) =  φ2 0 2t2 0  (15)  (16)  (θ − 1) e−2φ1/φ0 + (θ + 1) e−2φ2/φ0  (cid:35)  +2θe−(φ1+φ2)/φ0  .(23)  Here, φ0, t0 are constants, and θ = 12πGφ2 tions (22), (23) do not satisfy the condition (18).  0. The solu- If we divide the term with e−(φ1+φ2)/φ0 in the potential (23) symmetrically between V1 and V2 in Eq. (13), the interaction function Q (16) will be  (cid:0)e−φ1/φ0 + e−φ2/φ0(cid:1) e−(φ1+φ2)/φ0.  Q = − φ2 0θ 2t3 0  It may be expressed via the Hubble parameter (22) and the densities  (14) ρj = 1  e−φ2/φ0(cid:1) e−φj /φ0 as follows:  0θt−2  2 φ2  0  (cid:0)e−φ1/φ0 +  Q = 3ξH  ρ1ρ2  ρ1 + ρ2  .  (24)  Here ξ = −1/θ. The interaction function (24) may be deduced in another way [65], if we require for the system (5), (6), that the ratios r = ρc/ρx, wc = pc/ρc and wx = px/ρx are constants. These conditions for Eqs. (5), (6) lead to the equality  4  Note that in the case h0 = 2/3 interaction vanishes and we have the potential (17), that means, V = V1(φ1) + V2(φ2) (or V2 = 0). But for h0 (cid:54)= 2 3 the interaction term (16) Q = ˙φ1 ∂V2 is nonzero and may be presented in the ∂φ1 following forms:  2 − 3h0 3h0 γ1(3h0 − 1)  ,  Q = 3Hξ1ρ1,  ξ1 =  (28)  Q = 3Hξ2ρ2,  or in the form (24) with ξ =(cid:0)2 − 3h0 + γ1  ξ2 =  3h0(3h0 + γ1/2)  (29)  ,  (cid:1)(cid:14)(cid:0)3h0 + γ1  2  (cid:1).  2  Here, the ‘DE component’ density ρ2 is proportional  to ρ1, but pressure p2 remains nonzero  ρ2 =  h0(2 − 3h0)(3h0 + γ1/2) 8πG(2 − 3h0 + γ1/2) t2 ,  h0(2 − 3h0)  8πGt2  .  p2 =  The densities ρ2 and ρ1 = φ2  are positive in the following three physical cases:  (30) 0/t2 with φ0 from Eq. (27)  d dt  log r = − Q ρc  − Q ρx  + 3H(wx − wc) = 0,  (a)  h0 >  2 3  that is equivalent to Eq. (24).  Another variant of an interacting model may be de- scribed by a potential of the type (23), however, we im- pose the condition (18) and choose V1(φ1) depending only on φ1 as follows:  (b)  1 3  < h0 <  (c)  0 < h0 <  , −6h0 < γ1 < 0 ⇒ Q < 0;  , γ1 > 0 ⇒ Q > 0; 2 3 , max{−6h0, 6h0 − 4} < γ1 < 0 ⇒ Q > 0. 1 3  V (φ1, φ2) = V1(φ1) + V2(φ1, φ2) =  e−2φ1/φ0  φ2 0 2t2 1  +A2tγ1  1 tγ2  2 eγ1φ1/φ0+γ2φ2/ψ0.  Here, φ0, ψ0, A2, tj, γj are constants and  γ1 + γ2 = −2.  We consider the solution  φ1 = φ0 log  , φ2 = ψ0 log  , H =  , h0 = const,  t t1  t t2  h0 t  (26) unlike Eq. (22) it has no future singularity, but under the condition (18), that means p1 = 0, we obtain  ρ1 = ˙φ2  1 = 2V1 =  φ2 0 t2 ,  V2 =  A2 t2 .  We use equations (3), (11), (12) to express the con- stants in Eqs. (25), (26) via dimensionless parameters γ1 and h0:  φ2  0 =  2ψ2  0 =  A2 =  γ1h0(3h0 − 1)  ,  8πG(2 − 3h0 + γ1/2) (2 + γ1)h0(2 − 3h0) 8πG(2 − 3h0 + γ1/2) , h0(3h0 − 1)(2 − 3h0) 8πG(2 − 3h0 + γ1/2)  .  (27)  (25)  In the cases (b) and (c) we deal only with a quintessential DE (2 = 1) and obtain Q > 0, but in the variant (a) we have Q < 0 and can construct this ﬂuid with both signs of 2. We consider DM as cold (that means pressure-less) un- der the condition (18) with pc = 0 (pc ≡ p1), and DE as vacuum (px = −ρx). So the equations (5) and (6) for ρc ≡ ρ1 and ρx ≡ ρ2 take the form  ˙ρc + 3Hρc = −Q, ˙ρx = Q,  (31) (32)  where Q is the interaction function that has been already mentioned earlier. The sign of the interaction rate has a physical meaning. For positive values of the interac- tion rate, that means for Q > 0, the transfer of energy and/or momentum takes place from pressureless DM to DE while its opposite sign that means, Q < 0 refers to the opposite case, i.e., energy ﬂow takes place from DE to pressureless DM. Now, for any arbitrary given interac- tion function, Q, using the above conservation equations (31), (32) together with the Hubble equation (3), one can solve the evolution of (ρc, ρx) either analytically or nu- merically. Usually, for any arbitrary interaction function, the background evolution of (ρc, ρx) cannot be analyt- ically found. For some speciﬁc interaction models, it is possible to impose some analytic structure on the back- ground evolution of the dark sectors’ energy densities.  3.  INTERACTION MODELS AND THEIR  PERTURBATIONS  As alreday shown in section 2, the ﬁeld theoretic ap- proach returns some well known interaction models, such as the interaction model in which the interaction function is proportional to their individual energy density, namely, Q ∝ ρc, Q ∝ ρx and another model which has a nonlin- ear structure involving the energy densities of the dark sectors (Q ∝ ρcρx(ρc +ρx)−1). So, one can clearly justify that the linear combination of the energy densities of the dark components could be another feasible interaction model. Thus, in summary, we consider the interaction models shown in Table I, that we plan to examine in this work.  In the following we discuss the perturbations equations of the present interaction models in a perturbed FLRW metric given by [78, 79, 80]  ds2 = a2(τ )  − (1 + 2φ)dτ 2 + 2∂iBdτ dxi  (cid:35)  (cid:17)  (1 − 2ψ)δij + 2∂i∂jE  +  dxidxj  ,  (33)  (cid:34)  (cid:16)  where τ is the conformal time and the symbols, namely, φ, B, ψ, E, are the gauge-dependent scalar perturbation quantities. Now, in the context of interaction, one could easily calculate the gravitational ﬁeld equations for the above perturbed metric (33), see for instance [81, 82, 83, 84]. Here, we ﬁx the synchronous gauge for our work, that means, we have φ = B = 0, ψ = η, and k2E = −h/2−3η, where k is the Fourier mode and h, η are the metric perturbations. Let us note that θ = θµ µ is the volume expansion scalar of the total ﬂuid, hence, θi stands for the volume expansion scalar for the i-th ﬂuid. For i = c we mean the cold dark matter and for i = x we mean the vacuum energy. We also introduce δA = δρA/ρA as the density perturbation for the ﬂuid A (= c, x). Now, since for all the interacting cases considered in this work, δx = 0. Hence, the perturbations equations for cold DM, are  c = − h(cid:48) δ(cid:48) + c = −Hθc, θ(cid:48)  2  aQ ρc  δc,  (34)  (35) where the prime ((cid:48)) stands for the derivative with respect to the conformal time τ and H is the conformal Hubble rate. The ﬁrst equation is known as the density pertur- bation and the second equation is known as the velocity perturbation. In the DM-comoving frame, the velocity for DM particles vanishes, that means, θc = 0. In the following we prescribe the exact perturbations equations for diﬀerent interaction models.  Thus, having the evolution equations of the dark sec- tors’ energy densities at the level of background (see the  (cid:111)  P ≡(cid:110)  5  discussions at the end of section 2) and perturbations, it is possible to proceed to examine the interacting scenar- ios with the use of latest observational data. The next section is devoted for this purpose.  4. OBSERVATIONAL DATA, STATISTICAL  METHODOLOGY AND THE RESULTS  We describe, in this section, the observational data and the methodology for the statistical analyses of the models. We use the latest cosmic microwave background observations from Planck 2018 [85, 86] and baryon acous- tic oscillations distance measurements [87, 88, 89]. To constrain the interacting scenarios, we use the cosmomc package [90, 91], a Markov chain Monte Carlo code used to extract the observational constraints. This code sup- ports the Planck 2018 likelihood and it has a valid con- vergence diagnostic by Gelman-Rubin [92]. Since in all the interacting scenarios that we consider in this work, vacuum interacts with cold DM, thus, the dimension of the parameter space is seven with the following parame- ters:  Ωbh2, Ωch2, 100θM C, τ, ns, log[1010As], ξ  ,  where the ﬁrst six parameters in P refer to the six pa- rameters of the ΛCDM model and the parameter ξ is the coupling parameter, mentioned earlier. In Table II, we show the ﬂat priors on various free parameters of the in- teracting cosmic scenarios during the statistical analysis.  4.1.  IVS0  We show the observational constraints on this inter- acting cosmic scenario in Table III and in Fig. 1 for Planck 2018 alone and Planck 2018+BAO data. We in- clude BAO with Planck 2018 in order to break the de- generacies between the parameters. From Planck 2018 data alone we ﬁnd that ξ (cid:54)= 0 is allowed at more than 68% CL (ξ = −0.0013+0.00077 −0.00077). So, a very mild interac- tion in the dark sector is signaled by Planck data alone, however, when BAO data are added to Planck CMB, ξ becomes very small compared to its estimation from Planck CMB alone, but within 68% CL, ξ = 0 is con- sistent (ξ = 0.00011+0.00040 −0.00040). The Hubble constant, H0 assumes very lower value (H0 = 63.93+3.44 3.38 , 95% CL, Planck 2018) compared to Planck’s ΛCDM based estima- tion [70] but with high error bars as one can see. When BAO are added to Planck 2018, H0 goes up with reduced error bars (H0 = 67.56+1.35−1.31, 95%, Planck 2018+BAO) and becomes consistent with Planck’s ΛCDM based esti- mation [70]. So, as we can see that the tension on H0 is not reconciled within this interacting scenario.  Regarding the estimation of Ωm0, we ﬁnd a very strong anti correlation with H0, and hence this parameter be- haves accordingly with the increase or reduction of the  Model No.  Expression for Q  Corresponding Cosmic Scenario  6  Model I  Model II  Model III  Model IV  3Hξρc  3Hξρx  (cid:16) ρcρx  ρc+ρx  (cid:17)  3Hξ(ρc + ρx)  3Hξ  IVS0  IVS1  IVS2  IVS3  TABLE I: We show the interaction models that we shall study in this work.

Hubble constant. An interesting observation from Fig. 1, speciﬁcally from the joint contour (Ωm0, σ8) is that, after the addition of BAO data to Planck 2018, the contour becomes vertical oﬀering no correlation between them, while we note that for Planck 2018 data alone, the cor- relation between these two parameters are existing.  In summary, for this interaction model we ﬁnd a very mild interaction in the dark sector which is much consis- tent with the non-interaction cosmology.  FIG. 1: One dimensional marginalized posterior distributions of some selective parameters and two-dimensional joint con- tours of various combinations of the model parameters for IVS0 scenario have been displayed.  4.2.  IVS1  The summary of the observational constraints on this interaction model has been shown in Table IV and in Fig. 2. One can clearly see that the estimations of the coupling parameter for both Planck 2018 and Planck 2018+BAO are large compared to the previous interact- ing scenario IVS0. For Planck 2018, we see that at more than 68% CL, ξ (cid:54)= 0 (ξ = 0.132+0.142 −0.077, 68% CL), but within 95% CL, ξ = 0 is allowed. For Planck 2018+BAO, within 68% CL, ξ = 0 is consistent. So, concerning the estimations of the coupling parameter, we can safely con- clude that a mild interaction is allowed within this inter- action scenario.  Concerning the estimation of H0, we ﬁnd an interest- ing observation as follows. For Planck 2018, we ﬁnd that H0 takes a very high value with respect to the ΛCDM  606468H00.30.350.40.450.5Ωm00.750.780.810.84σ80.0040.000ξ606468H00.300.350.400.450.50Ωm00.750.780.810.84σ8IVS0: Planck 2018IVS0: Planck 2018+BAOParameters  Ωch2 Ωbh2  100θM C  τ  ns  ln(1010As)  ξ  Ωm0 H0  Planck 2018  0.02230+0.00015+0.00030 1.04409+0.00258+0.00548  Planck 2018+BAO 0.0687+0.0244+0.0647 0.0996+0.0225+0.0353 −0.0677−0.0677 −0.0156−0.0383 −0.00015−0.00029 0.02233+0.00014+0.00028 −0.00014−0.00027 −0.00405−0.00493 1.04188+0.00086+0.00233 −0.00134−0.00207 0.055+0.0076+0.016 0.054+0.0075+0.015 −0.0083−0.016 −0.0079−0.015 0.9723+0.0043+0.0083 0.9734+0.0040+0.0079 −0.0040−0.0078 −0.0044−0.0081 3.057+0.016+0.033 3.055+0.015+0.031 −0.017−0.032 −0.016−0.030 0.059+0.053+0.110 0.132+0.142+0.169 −0.061−0.101 −0.077−0.197 0.261+0.056+0.095 0.191+0.075+0.1901 −0.046−0.099 −0.141−0.166 70.84+4.26+5.26 68.82+1.30+2.77 −2.50−5.94 −1.53−2.64  TABLE IV: Observational constraints at 68% and 95% CL on the interaction scenario driven by the interaction function Q = 3Hξρx, using the CMB data from Planck 2018 and the data from BAO.  based Planck’s estimation [70] having in addition signif- icantly high error bars that enables us it to reach its local estimation [93], and thus, within 68% CL, the ten- sion on H0 is resolved. When BAO data are added to Planck 2018, H0 is lowered with reduced error bars, how- ever, due to slightly increased estimated value of H0 hav- ingly slightly high error bars (H0 = 68.82+2.77−2.64, 95% CL, Planck 2018+BAO) compared to ΛCDM based Planck [70], the tension on H0 is mildly alleviated due to the high error bars.  Thus, in summary, this interaction model has the abil- ity to alleviate the H0 tension oﬀering a mild evidence of an interaction in the dark sector which is more pro- nounced for Planck 2018 alone.  4.3.  IVS2  We show the observational constraints for this interact- ing scenario in Table V and in Fig. 3. In a similar fashion we concentrate on the key parameters ξ and H0 for this model. Note that the observational constraints for this model are almost similar to the IVS0 scenario. Thus, similar to IVS0 scenario, for this interaction model, an evidence of a non-null interaction at more than 68% CL is favored (ξ = −0.0013+0.00085 −0.00081, 68% CL, Planck 2018) for Planck 2018 data. While for Planck 2018+BAO, ξ = 0 is consistent within 68% CL.  Concerning the estimations of H0 for both Planck 2018 and Planck 2018+BAO, we ﬁnd that for Planck 2018, it takes lower values with high error bars unlike to what we ﬁnd in ΛCDM based estimation [70]. Thus, the tension on H0 remains true for Planck 2018 data. However, when BAO data are added to Planck 2018, H0 slightly goes up with reduced error bars, but eﬀectively the H0 tension is not alleviated.  7  FIG. 2: One dimensional marginalized posterior distributions of some selective parameters and two-dimensional joint con- tours of various combinations of the model parameters for IVS1 scenario have been displayed.

IVS3  Finally, we consider the last interaction model in this series. Let us note that it is a nonlinear interaction model in the energy densities of the dark sectors’ components unlike the previous three interaction models which are linear in the energy densities of DM and DE. So, con- cerning its structure, it has certain interest in this con- text. In a similar way we summarize the observational constraints for this model in Table VI and in Fig. 4.  Concerning the observational constraints on the cou- pling parameter ξ, we notice that for both Planck 2018 and Planck 2018+BAO, ξ = 0 is consistent within 68% CL.

However, both the datasets allow the nonzero values of the coupling parameter. So, the possibility of interac- tion in the dark sector through this coupling function is equally probable.  From the constraints of H0, we see that Planck 2018 alone estimates a lower H0 with very high error bars (H0 = 66.34+6.93−6.13, 68% CL), and due to this, as one can see, within 68% CL, it almost reaches the local estima- tion of H0 [93], and thus, the tension on H0 is alleviated. Note that the alleviation of the tension is purely due to the error bars. However, when BAO data are added to Planck 2018, H0 goes up but its error bars are reduced signiﬁcantly compared to the error bars for Planck 2018, and eventually, the tension is not solved. We can say that the tension on H0 is slightly weakened.  Therefore, in conclusion, within this interaction model, a mild coupling between DM and DE is supported by the observational data. Additionally, the model is also able to alleviate the H0 tension due to its large error bars.  4.5. Model comparisons  In the previous subsections we have described the ob- servational constraints on the prescribed IVS scenarios. In this section we aim to compare the models through their observational direction as well as we also perform a  FIG. 4: One dimensional marginalized posterior distributions of some selective parameters and two-dimensional joint con- tours of various combinations of the model parameters for IVS3 scenario have been displayed.  Bayesian evidence analysis in order to test the observa- tional viability of the models with respect to some refer- ence model. Since ΛCDM is the ideal choice to compare the interacting cosmological models under consideration, therefore, for Bayesian evidence analysis, we set ΛCDM as the base/reference model.  In the ﬁrst half of this section we compare the mod- els focusing on their observational constraints as well as their eﬀects on the large scale of the universe. In the second half of this subsection we provide the Bayesian evidence analysis for all the models with respect to the base ΛCDM model.  In Fig. 5, we show the whisker graphs for the cou- pling parameter ξ of all the interacting scenarios, namely,  60636669H00.30.350.40.45Ωm00.750.780.810.84σ80.0040.000ξ60636669H00.300.350.400.45Ωm00.750.780.810.84σ8IVS2: Planck 2018IVS2: Planck 2018+BAO56647280H000.20.40.60.8Ωm00.60.811.2σ80.40.00.4ξ56647280H00.00.20.40.60.8Ωm00.60.81.01.2σ8IVS3: Planck 2018IVS3: Planck 2018+BAO9  FIG. 5: Whisker graphs of the coupling parameter ξ for all the interacting scenarios considering the datasets Planck 2018 and Planck 2018+BAO. The vertical dotted line present in each graph corresponds to ξ = 0. In the left graph we consider all four models while for clarity in the right panel we have considered the whisker plot only for the models IVS0 and IVS2. In the main text we have clariﬁed why we show two whisker graphs for showing the estimation of the coupling parameter, ξ.  and IVS2 are almost same. This is pretty clear from the right graph of Fig. 5.  In order to understand how the present IVS models could be eﬀective in alleviating/solving the H0 tension, in Fig. 6, we show the whisker graph for H0 (at 68% CL) for Planck 2018 and Planck 2018+BAO. The grey vertical band corresponds to H0 estimated by the Planck 2018 re- lease [70] and the pale blue vertical band denotes the H0 estimation by SH0ES collaboration [93]. One can clearly see from Fig. 6 that IVS0 remains unable to alleviate the H0 tension while the remaining three IVS models as- sume higher values of H0 for Planck 2018 alone. However, among IVS1, IVS2, and IVS3, from the analyses, IVS1 seems more sound to alleviate the H0 tension. Finally, one might be interested to look at the 3D scattered plots for the IVS models shown in Fig. 7 and 8. From the scattered plots displayed in Fig. 7 and 8 one can under- stand the behaviour of the coupling parameter, ξ, with higher and lower values of the Hubble constant, H0. For both Planck 2018 and Planck 2018+BAO, as we can see, for higher values of H0, ξ assumes (although mildly) pos- itive values, indicating an energy transfer from pressure- less DM to DE. For lower values of H0, exactly opposite scenario is conﬁrmed. The scattered plots actually give a nice statistical comparisons between the models.  We also display in Fig. 9 the temperature anisotropy in the CMB TT spectra for all the IVS models using some speciﬁc values of the dimensionless coupling parameter ξ. In the upper panel of Fig. 9 we show the CMB TT spectra for a speciﬁc positive value of ξ = 0.05 and in the lower plot of Fig. 9 we display the same physical quantity for negative value of the coupling parameter, that means, ξ = −0.05. For comparison purpose, we have also included the non-interacting ΛCDM scenario (ξ = 0). One can quickly realize that IVS0 and IVS2 are quite diﬀerent compared to IVS1 and IVS3. Let us de- scribe the physics behind the plots. From the upper plot  FIG. 6: Whisker plot showing the 68% CL constraints on H0 for all the interacting scenarios, namely, IVS0, IVS1, IVS2 and IVS3 considering the datasets Planck 2018 and Planck 2018+BAO. The grey vertical band refers to estimate of H0 by the Planck 2018 release [70] and the pale blue vertical band corresponds to the estimation of H0 (labeled as R19 in the main text) measured by SH0ES collaboration [93].  IVS0, IVS1, IVS2 and IVS3, considering the analyses Planck 2018 and Planck 2018+BAO. Let us note that for IVS0 and IVS2, the region of ξ coincides with the vertical line representing ξ = 0. The reason for such an overlap is that, for both IVS0 and IVS2, the constraints on ξ are very close to zero (see Tables III and V for this purpose). That is why in the right graph of Fig. 5 we have sepa- rately shown the whisker plot for IVS0 and IVS2. Now, from the left graph, one can safely conclude that models IVS1 and IVS3 assume similar constraints, although for IVS3, ξ < 0 is allowed.

One can understand this phenomena from the evolution of the matter-radiation  equality for all the IVS models. It is clear that if we add an interaction in the dark sector, the evolution of the CDM sector will not follow its usual evolution which is ρc ∝ a−3, hence, the evolution of the matter sector, Ωm (= Ωc + Ωb) that includes CDM and baryons, will  0.280.320.360.400.440.48Ωm0−0.004−0.0032−0.0024−0.0016−0.000800.00080.0016ξIVS0: Planck 201858606264666870H00.000.080.160.240.320.400.48Ωm0−0.16−0.0800.080.160.240.32ξIVS1: Planck 2018666870727476H00.270.300.330.360.390.420.450.48Ωm0−0.004−0.0032−0.0024−0.0016−0.000800.00080.0016ξIVS2: Planck 20186062646668H00.000.150.300.450.600.75Ωm0−0.75−0.5−0.2500.250.50.751ξIVS3: Planck 201860657075H00.280.290.300.310.320.330.34Ωm0−0.0015−0.001−0.000500.00050.0010.0015ξIVS0: Planck 2018 + BAO65.566.066.567.067.568.068.569.069.5H00.100.150.200.250.300.350.40Ωm0−0.1−0.0500.050.10.150.20.25ξIVS1: Planck 2018 + BAO6667686970717273H00.280.290.300.310.320.330.34Ωm0−0.0012−0.0008−0.000400.00040.00080.00120.0016ξIVS2: Planck 2018 + BAO6667686970H00.200.240.280.320.360.40Ωm0−0.16−0.0800.080.160.240.320.4ξIVS3: Planck 2018 + BAO6566676869707172H011  FIG. 9: We show the temperature anisotropy in the CMB TT spectra for diﬀerent IVS models using two speciﬁc values of the dimensionless coupling parameter ξ.

If one looks at the upper plot of Fig. 10, it is clear that for all IVS models, the matter-radiation equality happens earlier for ξ > 0 compared to the non-interacting ΛCDM model. Due to earlier matter-radiation equality, the sound horizon is de- creased, hence, for the present IVS models, the ﬁrst peak in the CMB TT spectrum is decreased. For IVS0 and IVS2, the matter-radiation equality happens much earlier compared to IVS1 and IVS3, and this has been encoded in the CMB TT spectrum in terms of signiﬁcant reduc- tion of the ﬁrst peak compared to other two IVS models. On the other hand, for ξ < 0, exactly the opposite sce- nario happens in the CMB TT spectrum (see the lower panel of Fig. 9) and this behaviour become clear when one looks at the corresponding matter-radiation equality presented in the lower plot of Fig. 10.

Here, Ωm de- notes the total matter sector that means cold dark matter plus baryons, that means Ωm = Ωc + Ωb. The horizontal line denotes Ωm = Ωr that means where matter density becomes equal to the radiation density. To draw both the plots, we set the following values of the parameters: Ωc0 = 0.28, Ωx0 = 0.68, Ωr0 = 0.0001, and Ωb0 = 1 − Ωr0 − Ωc0 − Ωx0 = 0.0399.  (upper panel of Fig. 11) and ξ < 0 (lower panel of Fig. 11). We again ﬁnd that the behaviour of IVS0 and IVS2 are completely diﬀerent (in fact, violent) compared to the other IVS models. To understand the behaviour of various IVS models compared to the no-interaction sce- nario, we have considered the matter power spectrum for the non-interacting ΛCDM model. From the upper plot of Fig. 11 we see that the amplitude of the matter power spectrum for all IVS models increases compared to the ξ = 0 case. The signiﬁcant increase in the matter power spectrum is transparent for IVS0 and IVS2 while for other two IVS models, it is quite diﬃcult to under- stand the changes in the matter power spectrum from the non-interacting scenario (ξ = 0). The enhancement in the matter power spectrum is for the earlier matter- radiation equality, see the upper plot of Fig. 10. The reverse situation occurs for ξ < 0 (see the lower plot of Fig. 11). In this case the matter power spectrum are suppressed and this again corresponds to the late matter- radiation equality as shown in the lower plot of Fig. 10. Thus, from the behaviour of the IVS models presented in the CMB TT and matter power spectra shown respec- tively in Fig. 9 and 11, it is clearly pronounced that  101102103l0100020003000400050006000l(l+1)CTTl/(2π)[µK2]ΛCDMIVS0:ξ=0.05IVS1:ξ=0.05IVS2:ξ=0.05IVS3:ξ=0.05101102103l0100020003000400050006000700080009000l(l+1)CTTl/(2π)[µK2]ΛCDMIVS0:ξ=−0.05IVS1:ξ=−0.05IVS2:ξ=−0.05IVS3:ξ=−0.05ΛCDMIVS0:ξ=0.05IVS1:ξ=0.05IVS2:ξ=0.05IVS3:ξ=0.0502000400060008000012345zΩm/ΩrΛCDMIVS0:ξ=-0.05IVS1:ξ=-0.05IVS2:ξ=-0.05IVS3:ξ=-0.0502000400060008000012345zΩm/ΩrDataset  Model IVS0 Planck 2018+BAO IVS0  Planck 2018  Planck 2018  IVS1 Planck 2018+BAO IVS1  Planck 2018  IVS2 Planck 2018+BAO IVS2  Planck 2018  IVS3 Planck 2018+BAO IVS3  12  ln Bij 4.2 6.7  1.0 1.8  2.8 6.7  0.3 1.4  TABLE VII: Summary of ln Bij values computed for the ΛCDM model with respect to IVS0, IVS1, IVS2 and IVS3.  we ﬁnd that ΛCDM is favored by the observational data over all the IVS scenarios, but the models, namely, IVS1 and IVS3 are relatively close to ΛCDM compared to the remaining two IVS models (IVS0 and IVS2). So, the models IVS1 and IVS3 have some importance according to the data.  5. CONCLUDING REMARKS  Interacting DM – DE models have gained potential in- terest for explaining various cosmological puzzles begin- ning from the cosmic coincidence problem to the H0 ten- sion. It has been almost 20 years as of now, interacting models have been investigated by various investigators. The interacting models are entirely dependent on the in- teraction function, Q, that determines the rate of energy transfer between the dark sectors DM and DE. Despite of a lot of investigations in this context, a fundamental ques- tion – what should be the possible functional form of Q – is still unknown to the cosmological community. Since the nature of DM and DE are unknown, it is very diﬃcult to extract the exact functional form for the interaction function. Thus, the easiest approach followed from ear- lier to present time, is to assume some phenomenological functions for Q and then to test them using the available cosmological data. The lack of a deﬁnite mechanism to construct the interaction functions raises questions over the interaction models. This motivated us to investigate the interaction models from the ﬁeld theoretical argu- ments with an aim to search for a valid route to ﬁnd out the models that are widely used. Our answer is af- ﬁrmative in this direction. We have shown that various linear and nonlinear interaction functions that have been widely examined in the past and present, can be derived. This is the main essence of this work and probably this is the ﬁrst time in the literature where we show the exact derivations of some very well known interaction models having a solid ﬁeld theoretic ground.  We then examine the interaction models using CMB data from Planck 2018 ﬁnal release and with the BAO data. The inclusion of BAO to CMB is motivated to  FIG. 11: Matter power spectrum for all the IVS scenarios using two speciﬁc values of the coupling parameter, ξ has been shown. The upper plot corresponds to ξ > 0 while the lower plot corresponds to the case with ξ < 0. To draw both the plots, we set the following values of the parameters: Ωc0 = 0.28, Ωx0 = 0.68, Ωr0 = 0.0001, and Ωb0 = 1 − Ωr0 − Ωc0 − Ωx0 = 0.0399.  models IVS0 and IVS2 are signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from the rest two IVS models, namely, IVS1 and IVS3, and additionally, they are very far from the non-interacting ΛCDM model which is only detected through the analysis of formation of structure of the universe.  Finally, we perform the Bayesian evidence analysis for a better understanding on the models with respect to some reference model. To calculate the evidences we use the MCEvidence [94, 95], a cosmological code for com- putating the evidences of the interacting scenarios (also see [96, 97] for detailed descriptions). To quantify the observational support of the models, we use the revised Jeﬀrey’s scale through diﬀerent values of ln Bij. The strength of evidence of the underlying model (Mj) with respect to the reference ΛCDM scenario (Mi) is charac- terized as follows [98]: (i) for 0 ≤ ln Bij < 1, a weak evidence, (ii) for 1 ≤ ln Bij < 3, a Deﬁnite/Positive evi- dence; (iii) for 3 ≤ ln Bij < 5, a strong evidence, and (iv) for ln Bij ≥ 5, a very strong evidence for the reference ΛCDM model (“i”) against the underlying model (here the interacting scenario) is considered. In Table VII we have summarized the values of ln Bij.

The results are summarized in Tables III, IV, V and VI. Our anal- yses show that although both Planck 2018 and Planck 2018+BAO mildly allow a non-zero interaction in the dark sector but ξ = 0 seems to be the most consistent picture. We also ﬁnd that the second interaction model, namely, IVS1 is the most promising candidate to alle- viate the H0 tension in an eﬀective way. The models have been investigated further through their eﬀects on the CMB TT and matter power spectrum. Such an anal- ysis is really important because this oﬀers more insights on the models. Our analyses clearly depict that IVS0 and IVS2 are diﬀerent compared to other models. We found that presence of an intearction in the dark sector alters the matter-radiation equality and hence this eﬀects are encoded in the CMB TT and matter power spectrum. We notice that IVS1 and IVS3 are relatively close to the ΛCDM model.  Finally, we perform a qualitative comparisons between  13  the IVS models through the observational constraints and the Bayesian evidence analysis with respect to the reference ΛCDM scenario. We ﬁnd that IVS0 and IVS2 behave similarly, on the other hand, IVS1 and IVS3 be- have similarly, but the last two models have essential advantages when we make the Bayesian evidence analy- sis. However, it is true that the ΛCDM scenario is still preferred over the IVS models.  6.
