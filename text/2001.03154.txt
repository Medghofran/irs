Received YYY; in original form ZZZ  ABSTRACT The variability of quasars across multiple wavelengths is a useful probe of physical con- ditions in active galactic nuclei. In particular, variable accretion rates, instabilities, and reverberation eﬀects in the accretion disk of a supermassive black hole (SMBH) are expected to produce correlated ﬂux variations in UV and optical bands. Recent work has further argued that binary quasars should exhibit strongly correlated UV and opti- cal periodicities. Strong UV-optical correlations have indeed been established in small samples of (N ∼< 30) quasars with well-sampled light curves, and have extended the ”bluer-when-brighter” trend previously found within the optical bands. Here we fur- ther test the nature of quasar variability by examining the observed-frame UV-optical correlations in a large sample of 1,315 bright quasars with overlapping UV and optical light curves for the Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) and the Catalina Real-time Transient Survey (CRTS), respectively. We ﬁnd that strong correlations exist in this much larger sample, but we rule out, at ∼95% conﬁdence, the simple hypothesis that the intrinsic UV and optical variations of all quasars are fully correlated. Our results therefore imply the existence of physical mechanism(s) that can generate uncorrelated optical and UV ﬂux variations.  Key words: quasars: general – galaxies: active – stars: variables: others  1 INTRODUCTION  Quasars are thought to be powered by gas accreted onto supermassive black holes (Lynden-Bell 1969). The black hole is fed by a geometrically thin accretion disk, whose thermal emission is stratiﬁed radially, with higher-energy radiation arising from the hotter inner regions (e.g., Frank et al. 2002). A prominent feature of quasars is their variability across multiple wavelengths. Quasars appear to vary on time-scales from minutes to years and their variability has been studied extensively. This is especially true in optical bands, where time-domain surveys have provided large samples of quasar light curves. The variability is stochastic, and well described by random Gaussian ﬂuctuations, whose auto-correlation function obeys the so-called “damped random walk” (DRW) model (e.g., MacLeod et al. 2010; Kelly et al. 2009; but see Smith et al. 2018 for a discussion on discrepancies from this model). Similar behavior is also seen in the ultraviolet (UV) band, with generally larger variability amplitudes (Welsh et al. 2011; Gezari et al. 2013; Zhu et al. 2016).  The origin of the stochastic variability is currently poorly understood, but in general, ﬂuctuations in the ac- cretion rate (Pereyra et al. 2006; Schmidt et al. 2012; Li & Cao 2008; Ruan et al. 2014), instabilities or inhomogeneities  (cid:63) E-mail: mcharisi@caltech.edu  © 2019 The Authors  in the accretion disk (e.g. Dexter & Agol 2011), and repro- cessing of variable higher-energy (X-ray) emission from a hot corona within a few gravitational radii of the central SMBH (Krolik et al. 1991; George & Fabian 1991) could all cause variability in optical and UV bands.  All of the above mechanisms are expected to induce variability that is correlated across wavelengths. Indeed, cross-correlations within the optical bands are well estab- lished, with a clear ”bluer-when-brighter” trend (Vanden Berk et al. 2004; Wilhite et al. 2005; Schmidt et al. 2012). These inter-band correlations should be especially useful to constrain physical models, since in the radially stratiﬁed disks, the UV and optical emission regions are expected to be spatially well separated and therefore need not necessarily co-vary (e.g., if there are localized temperature ﬂuctuations in an inhomogeneous disc; Dexter & Agol 2011). For ex- ample, inter-band cross-correlations have been used to test whether variability can be fully explained by changes in the accretion rate of a quasi-steady disc, with early work ﬁnding consistency (Pereyra et al. 2006), but recent studies ﬁnding that accretion rate variations alone cannot fully explain the observed color variability (Schmidt et al. 2012; Ruan et al. 2014; Kokubo et al. 2014). Likewise, localized temperature ﬂuctuations appear not to be the main driver of optical color variability (Ruan et al. 2014; Kokubo 2015).  Cross-correlations have also been established between  2  C. Xin et al  the UV and optical bands (Hung et al. 2016; Edelson et al. 2019). Because UV data are typically sparse, previous stud- ies of the optical-to-UV cross-correlations have been per- formed only on small samples. For example, Edelson et al. 2019 relied on well-sampled light curves, obtained via in- tense monitoring of four AGN in optical and UV (as well as X-ray) bands with Swift. They ﬁnd strong UV/optical cross- correlations, with time-lags (on the order of a τ ∼ day) whose value is larger, but the scaling consistent with τ ∝ λ4/3 ex- pected in a radially stratiﬁed and centrally illuminated thin disk. Similar results were found by Fausnaugh et al. (2016) for the Seyfert galaxy NGC 5548 with an active nucleus, using ground-based optical monitoring, combined with UV data from the Hubble Space Telescope and Swift. Hung et al. (2016) analysed the wavelength-dependent variability of 23 AGN with large optical variability in the Panoramic Sur- vey Telescope and Rapid Response System (Pan-STARRS), combined with two epochs of UV data, separated by approx- imately a year, in the GALEX Time Domain Survey. They found that the UV/optical correlations for 17 out of the 23 quasars are consistent with the variable accretion-rate disk model.  Additionally, recent work has identiﬁed possibly sig- niﬁcant optical periodicity in a small fraction of quasars (Graham et al. 2015; Charisi et al. 2016; Liu et al. 2018). These quasars have been proposed to host binary SMBHs, whose orbital motion is expected to induce periodic vari- ability due to hydrodynamical modulations in the accretion rate (e.g., Hayasaki et al. 2008; MacFadyen & Milosavlje- vi´c 2008; Roedig et al. 2011; Shi et al. 2012; D’Orazio et al. 2013; Farris et al. 2014; Mu˜noz et al. 2019), as well as due to relativistic Doppler boost of the emission from gas bound to individual SMBHs (D’Orazio et al. 2015; Charisi et al. 2018; Xin et al. 2019). The latter eﬀect induces strongly correlated variability in optical and UV bands with amplitudes that de- pend on the spectral curvature. Given the limited quality of currently available UV light curves, Doppler-boost variabil- ity can be confused with the multi-wavelength variability of aperiodic single-SMBH quasars (Charisi et al. 2018).  In this paper, we complement previous work by exam- ining the UV vs. optical cross-correlations in a large sample of quasars. Our motivation is to assess whether tight corre- lations are generic and exist in all quasars, or if there are examples of uncorrelated, or only partially correlated optical and UV ﬂux variations. In order to do this, we created a sam- ple of > 1, 000 sources, which have adequately sampled and overlapping UV and optical time-series, from GALEX and CRTS, respectively. By analysing the covariance between the pairs of light curves, we ﬁnd that strong correlations exist in this larger sample, but we rule out, at ∼95% conﬁdence, the simple hypothesis that the intrinsic UV and optical varia- tions of all quasars are fully correlated. Our results therefore imply the existence of physical mechanism(s) that can gen- erate unrelated optical and UV ﬂux variations. The rest of this paper is organised as follows. In § 2, we describe our methodology, including the UV and op- tical quasar catalogs we used (§ 2.1), the construction of our joint UV+optical sample of 1,315 sources (§ 2.2), and our analysis of the light curves, including the computation of the cross-covariance between the noisy and sparsely and heterogeneously sampled pairs of time-series (§ 2.3). In § 3 we present our ﬁndings, in the form of the distribution of  the cross-correlation coeﬃcients found for the 1,315 quasars. These distributions are determined both by intrinsic corre- lations, as well as the data quality; we compare them with the distributions predicted under diﬀerent assumptions of the underlying intrinsic correlations. In § 4 we discuss these results, including the impact of the poor sampling, limited baselines, and photometric noise, as well as the possibility of time-lags and partial correlations. Finally, we summarize our ﬁndings and conclusions in § 5.  2 SAMPLE SELECTION AND DATA  ANALYSIS  2.1 UV and Optical Data  In order to study the observed-frame correlation between UV and optical variability in a large sample of quasars, we ex- tract UV and optical light curves from GALEX and CRTS, respectively. The combination of these two surveys is opti- mal, because both are all-sky surveys, covering large samples of quasars, the light curves of which have signiﬁcant tempo- ral overlap.1  In particular, GALEX (Martin et al. 2005) was the ﬁrst all-sky survey in the UV band. GALEX operated from 2003 to 2012 and provided simultaneous photometric measure- ments in two UV ﬁlters, in the far-UV (1350 − 1750 ˚A) and near-UV (1750 − 2750 ˚A) bands (hereafter FUV and NUV, respectively). It performed three main surveys: (i) an all- sky imaging survey (40,000 deg2) with a limiting magnitude of mAB ∼ 20.5, (ii) a medium imaging survey (1000 deg2) with limiting magnitude mAB ∼ 23, and (iii) a deep imaging survey (100 deg2) with limiting magnitude mAB ∼ 25. In ad- dition, from 2008 to 2011, GALEX performed a time-domain survey (40 deg2) with a 2-day cadence (Gezari et al. 2013). CRTS (Drake et al. 2009) is an ongoing time-domain survey, which covers the majority of the sky from decli- nations of −75◦ to 65◦, with the exception of the galactic plane, in unﬁltered optical light, broadly calibrated in the Johnson V-band. It began operations in 2005 and the most recent data release (Data Release 2), which we use, extends to 2014.2 CRTS covers up to ∼2500 deg2 per night and each visit consists of four exposures, separated by 10 minutes.  2.2 Sample Selection  Our basic approach is to study as large a population of quasars as possible. For this, we ﬁrst select the sample based on the UV light curves, and after necessary quality cuts, we cross-correlate with CRTS. This strategy maximizes the sample of quasars with suitable data, since it optimizes the selection for the UV sample, which typically has lower qual- ity data. We note that even with this strategy, it is still  1 Note that GALEX is the only wide and deep time-domain sur- vey in UV, whereas in the optical, Pan-STARRS and the Palomar Transient Factory (PTF) are less ideal for this study, because they began operations after CRTS, and their overlap with GALEX is more limited. 2 Even though CRTS continues operations, the most recent data are not publicly available.

The number of GALEX visits are shown against the total baseline for the entire NUV and FUV samples, in dark and light blue, respectively. The red dashed lines denote necessary quality cuts on the light curves (i.e. at least 10 visits and baselines of 500 d). These cuts exclude the sources in the shaded area from our ﬁnal sample.  Figure 2. The top panel shows the mean NUV magnitude vs. the number of GALEX visits for each source. The dashed lines mark cuts corresponding to various diﬀerent minimum number of visits.

Our starting sample is the Half Million Quasars cat- alogue (HMQ; version 4.4; Flesch 2015), which consists of 424,748 spectroscopically conﬁrmed quasars. We extracted sources within 5 arcsec from the input position using the ﬁ- nal GALEX data release (DR6/7).3 Of the quasars in the HMQ catalogue, 159,750 have at least one observation in the NUV band. The extracted sample contains a broad pop- ulation of quasars at various redshifts (up to z ≈ 5), and NUV magnitudes (16 ∼< mAB(NUV) ∼< 24), as shown by the  dark blue points and curves in Fig. 3 below.  In Fig. 1, we show the number of observations versus the baseline of the light curves for the entire GALEX sample in both the NUV and FUV bands. The typical light curves from GALEX are sparse with only a few epochs, but there is a large variety in terms of number of observations and temporal baselines ranging from a few days up to 10 years, similar to the ﬁndings in Welsh et al. (2011). It is also clear that the selected quasars have fewer data points in FUV compared to the NUV band, as expected due to the fact that the FUV detector was operational over a shorter time span. For this reason, in the remainder of this paper, we focus only on the NUV light curves.  In order to avoid possible biases associated with too few observations, we select light curves based on the num- ber of data points. In Fig. 2 (bottom panel), we show the number of quasars remaining in the sample as a function of the minimum allowed number of observations. As ex- pected, requiring more visits results in a declining number of available quasars. We set the minimum required number of GALEX visits to 10, which ensures relatively more fre- quently sampled sources, while maintaining a large sample of 13,087 quasars. In Fig. 2 (top panel), we show the mean NUV magnitude versus the number of GALEX visits; the  3 https://asd.gsfc.nasa.gov/archive/galex/  MNRAS 000, 1–11 (2019)  NUV catalog (both initially and after the aforementioned quality cut) consists of quasars with a wide range of mean photometric magnitudes. Among these 13,087 GALEX NUV sources, we exclude light curves with baselines shorter than ∼500 days. We have found it necessary to exclude these light curves, because for the cross-correlation analysis, we need at least three dis- tinct well-separated epochs.4 Light curves spanning less than ∼500 days are typically observed for only two epochs, as can be inferred from the sampling pattern in Fig. 1. In addi- tion, the typical DRW timescale τ is a few 100 days. As a result, in order to fairly sample the light-curves, the overlap should cover longer periods for an unbiased measurement of cross-correlations. This additional requirement resulted in a relatively minor cut, eliminating only 900 of the 13,087 quasars.  The remaining 12,187 quasars in the GALEX UV cata- log are then cross-matched with their optical counterparts in the CRTS catalog.5 We extract light curves within 3 arcsec from the HMQ catalogue coordinates, which returns a total of 2,840 quasars.  For the cross-correlation analysis, we need overlapping optical and UV data, which imposes further cuts on the sam- ple. For this, we identiﬁed the temporal overlap between the UV and optical light curves of each source, and excluded sources whose NUV light curve did not cover at least three distinct epochs within the optical baseline. Finally, we then excluded sources with sparse optical data and with unreal- istically high virial black hole mass estimates (see § 2.3.2  4 In the UV light curves, we deﬁne an epoch as a cluster of time- ordered points separated with gaps smaller than 30 days. While somewhat ad-hoc, we have found that in practice, this deﬁnition identiﬁes the discrete clusters of data-points (e.g. ≈10 such clus- ters are seen among the gray points Fig. 5). 5 http://nesssi.cacr.caltech.edu/DataRelease/  4  C.

Overall, these selections result in 1,315 high-quality (according to our criteria) pairs of light curves.  In Fig. 3, we show the distribution of redshift and NUV magnitude for the initial sample extracted from GALEX along with the ﬁnal sample of 1,315 quasars. The proper- ties of our ﬁnal sample resemble those of the input par- ent sample, without introducing signiﬁcant biases. Speciﬁ- cally, our ﬁnal sample covers broad ranges of redshifts and magnitudes, similar to those in the original GALEX and CRTS catalogs. Fig. 3 shows that the redshift distribution of our sample preserves the peak at z ≈ 1, although it also shows that our selection removes sources with higher red- shifts, which tend to be dim with sparse light curves. The magnitude distribution is similar to the initial sample, ex- cept that sources at the rare faint and bright tails of the distribution are missing from the ﬁnal sample. For the ﬁnal sample, we also illustrate the mean NUV magnitude versus the mean V-band magnitude, in Fig. 4. The magnitudes in the two bands are tightly correlated, and the optical magni- tude is typically brighter than the NUV, as expected from the typical spectral energy distribution of quasars.  2.3 Data Analysis  2.3.1 Observed Data  In order to characterize the correlations between optical and UV variability in the sample as a whole, we ﬁrst quantify the cross-correlation for each of the 1,315 sources individually. We ﬁrst pre-processed the light curves (optical and NUV) removing outliers and binning in one day intervals, following the steps in Charisi et al. (2016). Note that the short-term variability is not signiﬁcant for the cross-correlation analysis and thus binning does not aﬀect our results.  Calculating cross-correlations with our data is challeng- ing, because the observations in the two bands are not taken simultaneously. To address this, we interpolated the opti- cal light curves with a polynomial. We chose to interpolate the optical light curves, because the quality of the data is signiﬁcantly higher than in the NUV (i.e. the optical data typically have more epochs, smaller gaps and lower photo-  Figure 4.

We found the best-ﬁt polynomial for each binned optical light curve by varying the polynomial order from n = 6 to n = 30, and choosing the smallest n that produces a reduced χ2 close to unity. This process ensures reasonable ﬁts, while avoiding over-ﬁtting.  Fig. 5 illustrates a typical example of a pair of opti- cal and UV light curves, along with the best-ﬁtting polyno- mial for the optical data (shown with the black line). We computed the cross-correlation coeﬃcient, Ri, based on the overlapping part of the optical and UV light curves. Even though the polynomial ﬁts are a reasonable ﬁt for the op- tical light curves, they cannot be extrapolated beyond the range of available data. Therefore, we used only the UV data points whose dates fall inside the optical baseline (stars in dark blue in Fig. 5) and excluded the UV points outside this range (light blue points in Fig. 5). We then selected the points from the polynomial ﬁt that correspond to the times of the UV observations, giving us new optical points (red stars in Fig. 5) that are simultaneous with the UV.  Having calculated the magnitudes at N coincident times, the standard Pearson cross-correlation coeﬃcient can then be straightforwardly evaluated  [Cov(X, Y)]2  [Var(X)][Var(Y)],  XY ≡ R2 (1) where X = (x1, x2, ..., xN) and Y = (y1, y2, ..., yN) represent the optical and UV data vectors, at times (t1, t2, ..., tN). With the above method, we obtained the cross-correlation coeﬃcient Ri for each of the 1,315 sources and derived the correspond- ing distribution of the correlation coeﬃcient, P(Robs).  2.3.2 Modeling and Simulations  We performed a theoretical study of the optical/UV vari- ability of the population of quasars to explore whether the observed distribution P(Robs) reﬂects genuine correlations. First, we conducted a null test, in which the optical and UV light curves are completely uncorrelated. For this,  MNRAS 000, 1–11 (2019)  1718192021mAB (CRTS V)18192021222324mAB (GALEX NUV)Correlation between Optical and UV Variability of Quasars  5  Figure 5. This example source, SDSS J125731.3+001454, has an optical light curve (LC; data shown by gray circles with er- ror bars) that is well described by a best-ﬁt polynomial of order n = 15 with a reduced χ2 = 1.01 (black curve). The corresponding UV data points outside and inside the time interval that overlaps with the optical data are denoted by light blue circles and dark blue stars, respectively. The red stars mark the optical data in- terpolated to the times of the UV observations, using the best-ﬁt polynomial. The cross-correlation coeﬃcient measured between the red and dark blue stars is R = 0.86.  we randomly shuﬄed the pairings of the optical and UV data, i.e. every optical light curve is paired up with the UV light curve from a diﬀerent quasar, rather than from itself, so that no correlation is expected. We then repeated the calculation of the Ri for each pair of UV and optical light curves in this shuﬄed sample, following the steps detailed in § 2.3.1 and obtained the distribution of Ri for this null test P(Rnull). The advantage of this test is that does not make any assumption for the underlying variability, since it uses only observed data.  Next, we explored the level of correlations for the pop- ulation by generating model light curves with properties (sampling, photometric errors) similar to the observed ones, and performing the same cross-correlation analysis as above. In particular, we used the DRW model, which provides a successful description of quasar variability in optical and NUV (MacLeod et al. 2010; Zhu et al. 2016). The DRW pa- rameters (the characteristic correlation time-scale τ, and the variability amplitude ˆσ) depend on global quasar properties, such as the redshift, the absolute i-band magnitude and the black hole mass. For each quasar, we estimated the DRW parameters, using eq. 7 and Table 1 from MacLeod et al. (2010) for the SDSS r-band.6 For this, we extracted the red- shift from the HMQ catalogue, and calculated the absolute i-band magnitude, and from this the BH mass, following the steps in Charisi et al. (2016). The exception is that for 373 quasars in our ﬁnal sample, virial mass estimates were avail- able, which we adopted from Shen et al. (2008). This process produced 6 outliers with unrealistically large virial masses  Figure 6. Damped random walk (DRW) model parameters for the sample of 1,315 quasars estimated from their properties adopting correlations from MacLeod et al. (2010).  (∼ 1013−14M(cid:12)), likely misclassiﬁed blazars,7 which we ex- cluded from the sample (see also 2.2). The estimated DRW parameters are shown in Fig. 6.  With the DRW parameters estimated above, we gener- ated continuous mock light curves, sampled at 1-day inter- vals. We examined two scenarios: (A) a perfect correlation between optical and UV variability. In this case, the UV light curve is a rescaled version of the optical, with the rel- ative amplitude rq ≡ σopt/σUV assumed to be a free param- eter. (B) the optical and UV data are not fully correlated. For this, we assumed that a fraction of quasars fcor have fully correlated optical-UV variations, while the remaining (1 − fcor) have uncorrelated variations in the two bands (see also § 4.2). For the uncorrelated sources, we generated ran- dom realisation of the optical and UV light curves indepen- dently.  We down-sampled the continuous DRW light curves generated above, at the observational times by CRTS and GALEX, respectively. We added Gaussian deviates with zero mean and standard deviation equal to the photometric un- certainty of each point to incorporate the measurement er- rors. By preserving the observed properties in the simulated light curves, we account for systematic eﬀects introduced by the quality of the data. From the down-sampled opti- cal and UV light curves, we calculated the cross-correlation, as before, by interpolating the optical light curve with an nth-order polynomial, ﬁnding the overlapping interval and selecting the times that correspond to the UV observations. We repeated the process for the entire population, and we obtained the distribution P(Rmodel). Our analysis has two free parameters, the relative am- plitude of variability rq, which we allowed to vary from 0.5 to 4.5 and the correlated fraction fcor, which we varied be- tween 0 and 100%. We sampled the two parameters on an  6 The SDSS r-band is the closest to Johnson V band, in which the CRTS data are callibrated.  7 The estimation of the BH mass from the i-band luminosity from Shen et al.

For each pair of ( fcor, rq), we generated 20 indepen- dent realisations of the population, resulting in 20 indepen- dent P(Rmodel)-distributions for each of the 20 × 20 = 400 pairs of ( fcor, rq). We compared the simulated realisations P(Rmodel) with the observed P(Robs), using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (KS-test). In particular, we computed the KS distance (DKS) between the normalized cumulative distribution function (CDF) of Robs and each Rmodel. This provided 20 DKS values for each pixel on the ( fcor, rq) plane. We used the average, DKS, as the ﬁgure-of-merit to determine which set of param- eters better reproduces the observed distribution, with lower values corresponding to better ﬁts to the data.  3 RESULTS  We calculated the cross-correlation coeﬃcient for the pop- ulation of 1,315 quasars in our ﬁnal sample. In Fig. 7, we show the distribution of cross-correlation coeﬃcients Ri for the observed data P(Robs) with a solid gray histogram. The distribution shows a clear trend towards large Robs values, with a broad peak at 0.75 ∼< Robs ∼< 1.  We then performed a model independent null test, shuf- ﬂing the optical and UV pairs of light curves. The distribu- tion of Ri for this null test P(Rnull) is shown by the blue hatched histogram in Fig. 7. We see that in the limit of no correlation, the distribution P(Rnull) is relatively ﬂat for all values of Ri. In the ideal case, a delta function at R = 0 would be expected, but the sparse data ﬂatten the distribu- tion; we further explore the systematics introduced by the limited data quality in § 4.1. The excess of values at the positive correlation end in the observed distribution P(Robs) compared to the ﬂat Rnull distribution is a strong indication that the optical and UV variability is positively correlated in our sample. In other words, although the sub-optimal quality of data (e.g., due to sparse sampling, signiﬁcant photometric errors, non-simultaneous observations, etc.) may smear the appar- ent R-distribution, they do not, by themselves account for the skewed observed shape in P(Robs). Next, we compared the observed distribution P(Robs) with theoretical distributions produced from simulated light curves P(Rmodel). In Fig. 8, we show model distributions, assuming that the optical and UV variability are fully cor- related (scenario A), while varying the relative amplitude of variability rq. We see that the simulated distributions begin to approach the observed one as the variability amplitude is increased, with rq between 1.5 and 2.5 providing the best ﬁt. For even larger rq, the simulated histograms show overly skewed positive correlations. This is expected: as the UV variability stands out more above the noise, the intrinsic correlations show up more accurately in the measurements. The best-ﬁt values of 1.5 ∼< rq ∼< 2.5 are consistent with previous studies, which showed that quasars tend to have higher variability amplitudes at shorter wavelengths (Welsh et al. 2011; Gezari et al. 2013; Zhu et al. 2016; Charisi et al. 2018). Another important feature is that none of the model distributions for fully correlated variability can reproduce the observed distribution exactly; there is always an excess of Ri at negative values (R < 0).  Figure 7. Distribution of the cross-correlation coeﬃcient Robs between the optical and UV variability in our sample of 1,315 quasars (gray). The hatched histogram shows the same distri- bution obtained from a null-test, in which the optical and UV light curve pairings were randomly shuﬄed, so that no correla- tions are expected. The comparison between the two histograms reveals that the correlations in the data are genuine and are not produced by poor data quality alone.  The above ﬁnding led us to explore scenario B, in which we vary the fraction of quasars that are fully correlated fcor for a ﬁxed variability amplitude. We chose rq = 2.5, since, as seen in Fig. 8, this variability amplitude provides a rel- atively good ﬁt to the observed distribution. The resulting distributions are shown in Fig. 9.8 As this ﬁgure shows, for fcor ≈ 60%, the simulated distribution P(Rmodel) appears con- sistent with the observed P(Robs), whereas for higher/lower values of fcor, it becomes too steep or missing the peak near R ≈ 1, respectively.  The above two ﬁgures demonstrate the need to fully explore the parameter space, considering both the fraction of quasars that are fully correlated fcor and the amplitude ratio between stochastic UV and optical variability rq as free parameters. For each pair of ( fcor, rq), we generated 20 random realisations of the population and calculated the KS distance for each. In Fig. 10, we present our ﬁgure-of-merit, i.e. the average (from 20 realisations) KS distance between the modelled and the observed R-distributions (DKS), over our 2D parameter space. The colour-bar on the right side of the ﬁgure indicates diﬀerent values of DKS. The yellow contour on this 2D grid encloses all pixels which had the lowest DKS in any one of the 20 realisations. These represent the set of models which were found to be best-ﬁt models (i.e. the combination of parameters that returned the lowest DKS) in any of our 20 realisations.9 We interpret this region as our 95% conﬁdence region (i.e. the chance that the best-ﬁt model falls outside this region is ∼< 5%).  8 We did not reproduce the case with fcor = 100% in Fig. 9 — this is the same as the middle panel in Fig. 8, where all quasars have fully correlated optical and UV variability. 9 There are fewer than 20 pixels inside this contour, because two or more realisations sometimes yield the same best-ﬁt pixel.

Red triangles, blue circles and green squares illustrate rq= 1.1, 2.5 and 4.1, respectively. The relatively small error bars demonstrate that the observed minima are real and the observed trends are not sensitive to individual random real- isations of the population. As a result, the trend and peaks we see in Fig. 10 are robust. Overall, the ﬁgure-of-merit based on the KS-test shows a well-deﬁned peak at ( fcorr, rq)≈(60%, 2.5), representing the best-ﬁt parameter values, for which the predicted R- distribution is closest to the one observed. This corresponds to a simple model in which the UV vs. optical DRW am- plitude ratio is always 2.5, and in which 60% of all quasars have fully correlated UV vs. optical variability (with R = 1, otherwise R = 0). This model provides a good match to the observed R-distributions.  A corollary of our ﬁnding is that the simplest scenario, in which all quasars have well-deﬁned correlations between optical and UV variability, as may have been inferred from prior studies on a small sample of ∼ two dozen AGN, is ruled out by our analysis at high conﬁdence. We note however that in our analysis we simulated a population with a ﬁxed constant variability amplitude rq. It is possible that if we varied rq, we could reproduce the observed distribution Robs, even for fully correlated light curves. We will explore this case in future work.  Figure 10.

Ideally, we should infer a distribution similar to a delta function, with a peak at R = 0. This means that the limited data quality can intro- duce spurious cross-correlations (R (cid:44) 0). This could poten- tially be improved, if the light curves were sampled at higher cadence, had smaller photometric errors, or longer baselines. Here we examine the impact of these three aspects.  First, we explored systematics from the limited quality of the UV light curves, generating simulations of uncorre- lated light curves (R = 0), with a ﬁxed variability amplitude ratio at rq = 2.5 (as in Fig. 9). In order to understand the ef- fect of photometric errors of the UV simulated light curves, we set the photometric errors to zero (practically, we gen- erated noiseless DRW light curves), and kept the original cadence and baseline of the observations. The resulting dis- tribution is shown by the gray histogram in the top panel of Fig. 12. For reference, we also show the distribution, in which the photometric errors were included in the simula- tions in blue; this is the same as the top left panel of Fig. 9. The distributions (from simulations with and without UV photometric errors) are very similar, which indicates that the photometric errors have a negligible eﬀect and are not the main culprit for ﬂattening the R-distribution. The only visible diﬀerences appear near R ≈ ±1: the removal of purely random noise in the UV time-series makes it less probable for such strong (anti)correlations to arise by chance.  Then, we explored the eﬀect of sampling, generating high-cadence mock UV light curves. For this, we inserted 9 additional data points, spaced evenly between each two con- secutive observed times, such that the resulting UV MJDs are 10 times more densely sampled. We down-sampled the mock DRW light curves at the new UV MJDs to obtain UV light curves with higher cadence and no photometric errors. This new sample yields the blue hatched histogram at the bottom panel of Fig. 12. As the ﬁgure shows, the gains are  Figure 12. Distributions of the cross-correlation coeﬃcients (solid gray; same in both panels) of mock optical and UV datasets, assuming uncorrelated DRW variability in the two bands (true R = 0), noise ratio rq = 2, and no photometric errors. The dark blue hatched histogram in top panel denotes the distribution obtained from 10 times more densely sampled UV time-series, whereas the hatched histogram in the bottom shows the distribu- tion with the photometric errors included (same as the last panel with fcor = 0 in Fig. 9).  relatively modest, and the expected delta-function at R = 0 remains highly smeared out, despite the 10-fold increase in the density of the UV time-series.  BL ) (light blue) shows  5×BL) (medium) and P(RRW  Finally, we explored a more idealized case. We gener- ated optical and UV DRW time-series with 1 day cadence, and with the same baselines (i.e. the baselines of the opti- cal DRW light curves) in the two bands. We repeated these idealized simulations with extended baselines of either 5 or 10 times their original optical baselines. The three distribu- tions are shown in Fig. 13, where P(RRW the case, where the length of the DRW light curves is ﬁxed at the observed value of the initial optical light curves plus 10×BL) (dark) show the distribu- P(RRW tions for the extended light curves with 5× and 10× longer baselines, respectively. The light blue distribution shows a signiﬁcant improvement compared to the dark blue distri- bution in Fig.12, which means that the even denser and co- incident sampling both for the optical and UV light curves reduces the chance of detecting correlations by chance. How- ever, the distribution is still relatively broad. As can be seen from Fig. 13, the distributions obtained from DRWs with longer baselines converge more closely to the expected delta function.  4.2 Partial Correlations  We tested a simple scenario, in which a fraction of quasars are fully correlated and the rest have fully uncorrelated UV and optical variability. In general, there could be diﬀerent levels of partial optical-UV correlations, and this level can be diﬀerent from one source to another, i.e. each quasar could have a partially correlated optical-UV variability with R ∈  MNRAS 000, 1–11 (2019)  01020304050607080901000.000.050.100.150.200.250.30rq=1.1rq=2.5rq=4.1fcor[%]DKS1.000.750.500.250.000.250.500.751.0001020304050Number of Quasars1.000.750.500.250.000.250.500.751.00R01020304050Number of QuasarsCorrelation between Optical and UV Variability of Quasars  9  Figure 13.

In fact, this already seems to be the case for the well- sampled light curves in Edelson et al. (2019). We calculated the cross-correlation coeﬃcients for these sources between the V and M2 bands10 light curves (NGC 4151, R = 0.81; NGC 5548, R = 0.92; NGC 4593, R = 0.62; Mrk 509, R = 0.97). Note that, since these light curves are well-sampled, for this calculation we omitted the polynomial interpolation of the optical light curve, which likely introduces additional biases.  In this paper, we focused on testing the ﬁrst hypothesis (a fraction of quasars have fully uncorrelated data), which is the simplest to implement. However, given the quality of the data, we expect that the two cases will likely produce indistinguishable distributions. While we will not evaluate the second case here, we defer to future work to assess how well a population of quasars with partially correlated light curves ﬁts the same data analysed here. This can be attained by generating pairs of mock DRW light curves whose input is R < 1.  4.3 Time delays  If the UV/optical luminosity arises via reverberation of a central illuminating source, the variability should track one another, but with a time-delay that corresponds to their relative distances to the central source. Typical delays are expected to be on the order of days (see, e.g., Edelson et al. 2019 and references therein). Even for the massive quasars in our sample, with SMBH mass of ∼ 109 M(cid:12) the light-crossing time is ∼12 days, given the expected size of the optical emis- sion, which is ∼100 RS, where RS is the Schwarzschild radius. Observationally, the size of the optical emission region is  10 The M2 band is the closest to GALEX NUV.  MNRAS 000, 1–11 (2019)  Figure 14. Average KS probability from 20 realisations for each pixel as a function of the fraction of quasars fcor and the variability amplitude rq The yellow contour indicates the 95% conﬁdence level (same as the yellow contour in Fig. 10)  smaller (e.g., Fig. 1 in Morgan et al. 2007 shows < 1016 cm, corresponding to a light-crossing time of ∼4 days).  Our data are not suﬃciently well sampled to be sensitive to these short delays. We veriﬁed this expectation by sim- ulating optical and UV light curves with time lags between 1-100 days and repeating our analysis. For the simulations here, we adopted fcor = 60% and rq = 2.5. We calculated the average KS distance and found no signiﬁcant diﬀerence. We concluded that more densely sampled light curves are nec- essary to probe time-lags expected in reverberation models of thin disks.  4.4 KS Probability  In our analysis above, we quantiﬁed how well a model dis- tribution ﬁts the observed data using the KS distance. In the standard version of the KS test, the KS distance cor- responds to a probability that the examined distribution is drawn from a reference distribution. In our case, this can be loosely translated into the likelihood that our distribu- tion Robs was drawn from the predicted probability distri- bution Rmodel. However, the results need to be interpreted with caution, since the assumptions do not obey the for- mal requirements to convert the KS distance to probability. In particular, the Ri values are not drawn independently from the same distribution, because each Ri is calculated for a diﬀerent quasar. Since the properties of the individual pairs of light curves are not dramatically diﬀerent, the ob- tained probabilities should be approximately correct. With this caveat in mind, for each realisation of the population presented in Fig. 10, we calculated the KS probability. In Fig. 14, we show the average probability (pKS) for each of the 20×20 pixels on the ( fcor, rq) plane. We see that this ﬁgure delineates a similar region as the 95% contour we identiﬁed in Fig. 10, providing additional justiﬁcation for identifying this as our 95% conﬁdence region.  0.60.40.20.00.20.40.60.8R01020304050607080Number of QuasarsP(RRWBL)P(RRW5×BL)P(RRW10×BL)10  C. Xin et al  5 CONCLUSIONS  In this paper, we performed a study of the correlation be- tween UV and optical variability of quasars. These inter- band correlations are a useful probe of the physics of accre- tion disks in quasars, but they are challenging to measure, mostly because time-domain data in the UV are sparse. As a result, previous studies focused on a handful of quasars with targeted observations and well-sampled light curves in both bands; they found strongly correlated variability. Here we complemented previous studies and instead assembled a large sample of 1,315 quasars, selected from GALEX and CRTS. While this necessitated a compromise in the data quality for the individual light curves, we were able to anal- yse this sample statistically, and extract the intrinsic corre- lations between the optical and UV light curves for the pop- ulation as a whole. Our analysis utilized mock light curves, which mimic the important features of the data (such as sampling, baseline, and photometric errors). We also per- formed a model-independent null test, in which we random shuﬄed the pairings of the optical vs. UV light curves. We found that strong correlations exist in this much larger sample, but we ruled out, at ∼95% conﬁdence, the simple hypothesis that the intrinsic UV and optical varia- tions of all quasars are fully correlated. We explored a sim- ple model, in which a fraction fcor of quasars have UV light curves that are fully correlated with the optical, but with an amplitude that is scaled by a factor of rq, while the remain- ing fraction (1− fcor) are not correlated at all. We found that the values of fcor ≈ 60% and rq ≈ 2.5 best reproduce the ob- served distribution of correlation coeﬃcients. Therefore, our results imply the existence of physical mechanism(s) that can generate uncorrelated optical and UV ﬂux variations, such as expected, for example, from local temperature ﬂuc- tuations (Dexter & Agol 2011).  Future work should extend our analysis, by improved modeling of intrinsic quasar variability, and allowing for par- tially correlated UV vs. optical ﬂuctuations. Our study was also limited by the available UV data, ultimately resulting in a cut from ∼ 150, 000 quasars down to a sample of ∼ 1, 000 with suﬃcient overlapping optical and UV data. A future UV time-domain survey would yield great improvements. Our analysis in § 4, especially Fig. 13, further indicates that apart from the number of sources, the main limitation for our study was the length of the baseline: the best improve- ment would be provided by a large-area UV and optical sur- veys with simultaneous observations covering at least several years.
