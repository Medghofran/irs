Transmission observations of this system between the mid infrared and the far ul- traviolet have revealed the signature of atomic, molecular, and possibly aerosol species in the lower atmosphere of the planet, as well as escaping hydrogen and metals in the upper atmosphere. From a re-analysis of near- ultraviolet (NUV) transmission observations of HD 209458 b, we detect ionized iron (Fe+) absorption in a 100 Å-wide range around 2370 Å, lying beyond the planetary Roche lobe. However, we do not detect absorption of equally strong Fe+ lines expected to be around 2600 Å. Further, we ﬁnd no evidence for absorption by neu- tral magnesium (Mg), ionized magnesium (Mg+), nor neutral iron (Fe). These results avoid the conﬂict with theoretical models previously found by Vidal-Madjar et al. (2013), which detected Mg but did not detect Mg+ from this same dataset. Our results indicate that hydrodynamic escape is strong enough to carry atoms as heavy as iron beyond the planetary Roche lobe, even for planets less irradiated than the extreme ultra-hot-Jupiters such as WASP-12 b and KELT-9 b. The detection of iron and non-detection of magnesium in the upper atmo- sphere of HD 209458 b can be explained by a model in which the lower atmosphere forms (hence, sequesters) primarily magnesium-bearing condensates, rather than iron condensates. This is suggested by current micro- physical models. The inextricable synergy between upper- and lower-atmosphere properties highlights the value of combining observations that probe both regions.  Key words: Exoplanet atmospheres, Transmission spectroscopy, Radiative transfer  1. Introduction  The early G-type star HD 209458 hosts what is consid- ered to be the prototypical hot Jupiter. The ∼0.7 Jupiter-mass planet has an inﬂated atmosphere, an orbital period of about 3.5 days, and an equilibrium temperature of about 1500 K (Knutson et al. 2007). HD 209458 is among the ﬁve brightest and nearest stars known to host a transiting hot Jupiter (see, e.g., Edwards et al. 2019). In addition, HD 209458 b was the ﬁrst exoplanet detected in transit (Charbonneau et al. 2000) and the ﬁrst for which an atmosphere was detected (Char- bonneau et al. 2002). Consequently, HD 209458 b has been one of the most studied hot Jupiters to date with transmission and emission observations obtained from space and ground. These observations led to the detection of planetary atmo- spheric signatures ranging from the far-ultraviolet (FUV) to infrared bands.  patricio.cubillos@oeaw.ac.at  Shortly after the ﬁrst detection of the atmosphere of HD 209458 b at the position of the Na D lines (Charbon- neau et al. 2002), Vidal-Madjar et al. (2003) reported the detection of an extended hydrogen envelope surrounding the planet. This result was based on primary transit observa- tions obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) at FUV wavelengths, which revealed a ∼10% deep absorption in the wings of the Lyα line (the core of the Lyα line is completely absorbed by the interstellar medium; see also Ben-Jaffel 2007; Vidal-Madjar et al. 2008). The strength of the Lyα absorption signature indicated the presence of escaping atomic hydrogen outside the planet’s Roche lobe. This ﬁrst discovery inspired the development of a number of computational models aiming at describing the physical mechanisms of exoplanet atmospheric escape (e.g., Lammer et al. 2003; Yelle 2004; García Muñoz 2007; Murray-Clay et al. 2009; Koskinen et al. 2013a,b; Bourrier & Lecavelier des Etangs 2013; Kislyakova et al. 2014; Salz et al. 2015; Khodachenko et al. 2017; Carroll-Nellenback et al. 2017;  2  CUBILLOS et al.  Debrecht et al. 2018; Kubyshkina et al. 2018) and the effort to look for signatures of escape around other close-in planets and at different wavelengths. In fact, further UV observa- tions led to the detection of escaping atmospheres around the hot Jupiters HD 189733 b in the FUV (e.g., Lecavelier des Etangs et al. 2012), WASP-12 b in the near-ultraviolet (NUV; e.g., Fossati et al. 2010; Haswell et al. 2012), and indications for WASP-121 b in the NUV (Salz et al. 2019), and the warm Neptunes GJ 436 b and GJ 3470 b in the FUV (e.g., Ehrenreich et al. 2015; Bourrier et al. 2018).  The hot Jupiter HD 209458 b has since been observed at both FUV and NUV wavelengths, to further study atmo- spheric escape. The FUV observations focused mostly on detecting planetary atmospheric absorption at the position of resonance lines of abundant elements, particularly C, O, and Si. The observations led to the detection of O and C+ escap- ing from the planet (Vidal-Madjar et al. 2004; Linsky et al. 2010; Ballester & Ben-Jaffel 2015), while the detection of Si2+ is still controversial (Linsky et al. 2010; Ballester & Ben-Jaffel 2015).  1.1. NUV Atmospheric Characterization of HD 209458 b Vidal-Madjar et al. (2013) presented the results of three HST transit observations conducted at NUV wavelengths. Observing exoplanetary atmospheric escape in the NUV has some key advantages over the FUV (Haswell et al. 2012; Fossati et al. 2015; Haswell 2017): 1) for K-type stars and earlier, the NUV stellar emission is dominated by the photospheric continuum, which has a signiﬁcantly higher ﬂux than that the FUV emission lines, thus improving the signal-to-noise (S/N); 2) Because it is dominated by photo- spheric emission, the background over which a transit is ob- served is more homogeneous and less affected by bright/dark spots typical of the FUV chromospheric emission (see e.g., Haswell 2010; Llama & Shkolnik 2015, 2016). In addition, the NUV spectral range contains a large number of resonance lines of abundant metals (e.g., Mg, Fe, and Mn), some of which have been detected in escaping exoplanetary atmo- spheres (e.g., Fossati et al. 2010; Haswell et al. 2012; Sing et al. 2019).  Vidal-Madjar et al. (2013) reported the detection of plan- etary Mg absorption at 2.1σ level with Doppler velocities ranging between −62 and −19 km s−1 away from the po- sition of the Mg 2853 Å resonance line. Vidal-Madjar et al. (2013) and Bourrier et al. (2014, 2015) interpreted this as evidence of planetary Mg atoms escaping the planet’s atmo- sphere and moving away from its host star, accelerated by radiation pressure. Vidal-Madjar et al. (2013) also looked for Mg+ absorption at the position of the Mg+ h&k resonance lines at about 2800 Å, but without success. In addition, they binned the whole available spectral window to 200 Å bins looking for the rise of the planetary radius with decreasing wavelength due to Rayleigh scattering, but the data quality was not high enough to constrain the Rayleigh slope. The low ionization potential of Mg (7.65 eV) implies that radiation at wavelengths shorter than ∼1621 Å is capable of ionizing the atom. Since the photospheric continuum of  the G-type star HD 209458 starts rising near 1450–1500 Å (Vidal-Madjar et al. 2004; France et al. 2010), the detection of Mg and not of Mg+ came as a great surprise. Vidal-Madjar et al. (2013) explained this as due to electron recombination depleting Mg+ and enhancing Mg in the atmosphere and de- rived a minimum electron density of 108−9 cm−3 required to achieve this. This electron density is about a factor of ten higher than the peak electron density predicted by upper atmosphere models (107−8 cm−3; Koskinen et al. 2013a,b; Lavvas et al. 2014).  Furthermore, Bourrier et al. (2014) found that the best ﬁt electron density required to match the observations is even higher, at about 1010 cm−3. In addition to being signiﬁcantly higher than theoretical predictions, their estimate of the Mg+ recombination rate seems to assume that all available elec- trons are used to recombine Mg+. Since this is unrealistic, we infer that for recombination to explain the detection of Mg and the non-detection of Mg+, the required electron density must therefore be even larger than 1010 cm−3.  Motivated by these considerations, we present a re-analysis of the HST NUV observations of HD 209458 b. The primary aims of this work are to re-investigate the detection and non- detection of the Mg and Mg+ absorption, respectively, search for metal absorption lines in the entire STIS NUV spectrum, and attempt to reconcile the observations with theory. In Sec- tion 2, we describe the observation in more detail. In Section 3, we describe our data-analysis methodology. In Section 4, we provide a theoretical interpretation of the observations. In Section 5 we discuss the main implications of our anal- ysis and compare our results to those of Vidal-Madjar et al. (2013). Finally, we summarize our conclusions in Section 6.  2. Observations  We re-analyze the three archival NUV transmission ob- servations of the planetary system HD 209458, obtained with HST, using the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS, program #11576, Vidal-Madjar et al. 2013), the NUV Multi-Anode Microchannel Array (NUV-MAMA) detector, and E230M grating. Each transit observation (one HST visit) consists of ﬁve consecutive HST orbits, where each HST or- bit lasts for about 90 minutes. For each visit, the ﬁrst two and last HST orbits occur out of transit, the third orbit during the transit ingress, and the fourth orbit shortly after the mid- transit time. Each orbit consists of 10 consecutive exposures (frames) of 200 seconds each, except for the ﬁrst orbit, which consists of nine frames to accommodate acquisition observa- tions. Each frame consists of an echelle spectrum comprising 23 orders, in which each order consists of 1024 wavelength samples, with a resolving power of λ/∆λ = 30 000, and ap- proximately two pixels per resolution element (where the res- olution element is approximately 10 km s−1, or equivalently, 0.09 Å). The entire STIS spectrum covers the 2300–3100 Å range, with some overlap between the orders.  3. Data Analysis  We follow the standard procedure for extracting the plane- tary transit signature from time-series observations. We start  NUV TRANSMISSION SPECTROSCOPY OF HD 209458 B  3  the analysis from the CALSTIS1 (version 3.4) reduced and extracted spectra, which have been corrected for ﬂat-ﬁeld, extracted, corrected for background emission, and wave- length and ﬂux calibrated. Our analysis is based on the ﬂux calibrated spectra and their uncertainties, which account for photon noise and uncertainties on ﬂat-ﬁelding and ﬂux cal- ibration. We exclude the ﬁrst orbit from each visit and the ﬁrst frame from each orbit, since they show severe systemat- ics that we were not able to correct for.  In the following sections we describe our analysis,  in which we adopt a two-step approach. First, we character- ize instrumental systematics by using wavelength-integrated data (white-light analysis). Second, we obtain wavelength- resolved transmission spectra from the data that have been corrected for systematics (spectral analysis).  3.1. White-light Analysis  In this step, we integrate the ﬂux over each echelle spec- tral order to increase the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N), and then detrend the astrophysical signal from the instrumental- systematics. We begin by masking bad data points based on three criteria: ﬁrst, as stated above, we exclude the ﬁrst orbit from each visit and the ﬁrst frame from each orbit; second, we exclude data points with abnormally low uncertainties, i.e., an order of magnitude lower than the median uncertain- ties (typically, a handful of data points at the edges of the echelle order for each frame); and third, we use the overlap between the echelle orders to exclude data points where the ﬂuxes differ from each other by more than 5σ. Overall, this bad-pixel-masking procedure removes typically ﬁve pixels at each end of the echelle order, for each frame. We then pro- duce the raw white light curves by summing the ﬂux over each spectral order and propagating the uncertainties accord- ingly.  We ﬁt the raw light curves with parametric transit and sys- tematics models as a function of time (t) and wavelength (λ):  F (t, λ) = FsT (t, λ)S(t, λ),  (1) where Fs is the out of transit ﬂux, T (t, λ) is a Mandel & Agol (2002) transit model, and S(t, λ) is a model of the instrumen- tal systematics. To obtain statistically robust parameter esti- mations, we apply a Levenberg-Marquardt optimization to compute the best ﬁt parameters, and a Markov-chain Monte Carlo algorithm to compute the parameter credible intervals. To this end, we use the open-source MC3 Python package2 (Cubillos et al. 2017). For the MCMC exploration, we se- lect the Snooker Differential-evolution MCMC sampler (ter Braak & Vrugt 2008).  Except for the transit epoch, we ﬁx the orbital parameters to the values measured at optical wavelengths, since they are more precise than those we can infer from the NUV data. We assume an orbital period of P = 3.5247486 days (Knut- son et al. 2007), an orbital inclination of i = 86.66◦, and  1 http://www.stsci.edu/hst/stis/software/analyzing/calibration/pipe_soft_  hist/intro.html  2 https://mc3.readthedocs.io/  a semi-major axis to stellar radius ratio of a/Rs = 8.7947 (Hayek et al. 2012). These values ﬁt the NUV data well. Given the gaps in the HST observations, adopting different orbital-parameter values from the literature does not signif- icantly impact our results as they impact mostly the timing of the transit light curve rather than the relative depths as a function of wavelength, (see, e.g., furhter discussion in Evans et al. 2018).  For each order, we compute the four-coefﬁcient non-linear limb-darkening coefﬁcients (as deﬁned in Claret 2000) using the open-source routines of Espinoza & Jordán (2015), which we keep ﬁxed during the ﬁt. For this calculation, we con- sider the PHOENIX stellar model that most closely matches the physical properties of HD 209458 (effective temperature Teﬀ = 6000 K, surface gravity log g = 4.5, and solar ele- mental metallicity). Although ﬁxing the limb-darkening co- efﬁcients (instead of ﬁtting) is not optimal, the low S/N and the sparse coverage of the NUV transit light curve does not allow us to constrain the coefﬁcients sufﬁciently well. There- fore, the transit depth and out-of-transit ﬂux remain the only astrophysical ﬁtting parameters.  In addition to the astrophysical signal, we simultaneously ﬁt the HST instrumental systematics. HST time-series obser- vations show well known systematics that affect the different instruments and observing modes on board (e.g., Wakeford et al. 2016; Alam et al. 2018; Sing et al. 2019): the “breath- ing” effect, which varies with the HST orbital period, and visit-long trends. We model these systematics considering a family of polynomial curves as in Vidal-Madjar et al. (2013):  S(t, φ) = 1 + a1(t − t0) + a2(t − t0)2 + b1(φ − φ0) + b2(φ − φ0)2 + b3(φ − φ0)3 + b4(φ − φ0)4,  (2)  where φ are the HST orbital phases; ai and bi are ﬁtting pa- rameters for the visit-long and breathing systematics, respec- tively; and t0 and φ0 are a ﬁxed reference time and phase. We set t0 = T0(t) and φ0 = 0.2, the transit mid-time and HST mid-phase of the observations, respectively, to minimize cor- relations between the polynomial coefﬁcients. The expres- sion shown in Eq. (2) is the most complex form of R(t, φ) we considered, as we tested all possible lower-order polyno- mial expressions in t and φ.  We ﬁt the light curves testing each combination of poly- nomial degree in t and φ, selecting the preferred model by minimizing the Bayesian Information Criterion: BIC = χ2 + k log N, where k is the number of free parameters and N is the number of data points. Table 1 shows the results of the Bayesian model selection. For all visits, the BIC prefers linear polynomials in t and φ.  Figure 1 shows the best-ﬁtting transit depth for each visit and spectral order from the white-light analysis, for the pre- ferred systematics model in Table 1. Figure A1 shows the order-by-order white light curves and their best ﬁtting tran- sit model. Figure A2 compares sample order-integrated light curves with and without the ramp systematic correction. As in Vidal-Madjar et al. (2013), the transit depths of the ﬁrst  4  CUBILLOS et al.  Table 1.

In contrast, the third visit shows strong anomalous systematics of unknown origin that corrupt the transit ﬁt, producing wide variations in transit depth across the spectrum. Thus, as done by Vidal-Madjar et al. (2013), we discard the results from the third visit from further analyses.  3.2. Spectral Analysis  In this step, we divide the data into several spectral chan- nels to search for wavelength-dependent features in the trans- mission spectra. The main complication of the analysis is choosing the appropriate width of the wavelength channels. On the one hand, the expected NUV features are narrow ab- sorption lines a few km s−1 wide, but narrow wavelength channels do not provide sufﬁcient S/N to distinguish such features. On the other hand, broader channels build up S/N, but dilute the signal of potential spectral features. We thus analyze the data at four different spectral resolutions (25, 50, 100, and 1000 km s−1) to assess this trade-off. A posteriori, we found that the data show isolated absorption features that get quickly diluted as one lowers the resolution. Therefore, our main conclusions rely on the highest-resolution analysis  at 25 km s−1, aided by the coarse 1000 km s−1 analysis as a continuum.  3.2.1. Wavelength Correction  We begin the spectral analysis by reading and masking the raw light curves as in the white-light analysis. To account for possible wavelength distortions of the spectra during a visit, we calibrate and correct the wavelength solution of each echelle order in each frame, with respect to the stel- lar rest frame. As a reference spectrum, we use a high- resolution line-by-line stellar photospheric emission model of HD 209458, computed with the 1D plane-parallel stellar atmosphere code of Shulyak et al. (2004). We ﬁnd the wave- length correction for each order from the peak of the cross- correlation function between the Doppler-shifted data and the reference stellar spectrum.  Once calibrated, we Doppler-shift all light-curve frames of a given echelle order to a common wavelength solution us- ing a cubic spline interpolation, and renormalizing the ﬂux level to conserve the total ﬂux in each frame. Since the ﬂux uncertainties are Poison-noise dominated, we also use a cu- bic spline to estimate the uncertainties. To minimize the im- pact of the interpolation, we select as a reference point the frame that minimized the geometric mean of the shifts (of all the frames in a given order). As a result, 68% of the shifts are smaller than an eighth of a pixel. We remark that the wavelength correction is done order-by-order, thus it does not affect the total ﬂux of each order, though the interpo- lation modiﬁes the ﬂux in each pixel, thus it affects the light curves of the narrow spectral channels. Figure 2 shows the relative Doppler shift between the individual orders for each frame and visit. The wavelength calibration shows signiﬁcant shifts of nearly one pixel during a visit that varies systemati- cally with the visit-long frame number, HST-orbit-long frame number, and echelle order. Furthermore, each visit shows a distinct Doppler-shift pattern.  3.2.2. Divide-white Systematics Correction  Following Kreidberg et al. (2014), we adapted their HST/WFC3 “divide-white” spectral analysis to the HST/STIS NUV dataset. This is a two-step approach that uses the re- sults from the white-light analysis to remove the instrumen- tal systematics from the raw spectral light curves (hence, the “divide-white”). Here, we construct a non-parametric systematics model by dividing the white-light curve by its best-ﬁt order-by-order and visit-by-visit transit model, and normalizing the resulting quotient. Assuming that the instru- mental systematics vary weakly with wavelength (an appro- priate assumption for HST instruments, Alam et al. 2018), we divide the systematics model from each spectral light curve. The resulting light curves should then be dominated by the astrophysical transit signal.  We estimate uncertainties of the best-ﬁt white transit model from the standard deviation of the distribution for the white-light transit model, generated from the white-analysis posterior distribution. Then we use the error-propagation formula (see, e.g., Bevington & Robinson 2003) to account  23002400250026002700280029003000Wavelength(angstrom)0.000.030.060.090.120.15Rp/RsVisit 1Visit 2Visit 3NUV TRANSMISSION SPECTROSCOPY OF HD 209458 B  5  Figure 2.

The markers have been slightly shifted horizontally for better visualization. for all uncertainties throughout the steps involved to con- struct the non-parametric systematics model and obtain the systematics-corrected light curve.  Once we have obtained the wavelength- and systematics- corrected light curves, we bin the data to a wavelength ar- ray with a constant resolution, where for each spectral chan- nel, we co-add all ﬂux contributions from the two visits and from all echelle orders (in regions of overlapping orders), and propagate the errors accordingly.  3.2.3. Transmission-spectrum Extraction  To derive robust estimates of the transmission spectrum, we apply two independent approaches to analyze the spectral light curves. In our ﬁrst approach, we proceed in a similar manner as for the white-light analysis: we ﬁt a Mandel & Agol (2002) transit model to the systematics-corrected spec- tral light-curves in an MCMC run. As previously, we ﬁx the transit epoch, the orbital inclination and ratio between the or- bital semi-major axis and stellar radius (a/Rs). We also com- pute and ﬁx the non-linear limb-darkening coefﬁcients for each spectral channel. Therefore, we ﬁt for the transit depth and out-of-transit ﬂux level in each spectral channel. Since  the light curve combines data from different epochs, we ﬁt the out-of-transit ﬂux level of each visit with an individual free parameter. This approach produces statistically robust transit-depth estimates and maximizes the S/N; however, the results are inﬂuenced by the assumed limb-darkening coefﬁ- cients.  As a second approach, we replicate the procedure of Vidal- Madjar et al. (2013), computing the absorption depth (AD) from the ratio between the total ﬂux of the in-transit and out- of-transit HST orbits:  AD(λ) = 1 − F3 − F4 F2 − F5  ,  (3)  where Fi represents systematics-corrected ﬂux summed over the i-th HST orbit, from both visits, within a spectral chan- nel at wavelength λ. We propagate the errors according to Eq. (3) to obtain the uncertainties, as done in Vidal-Madjar et al. (2013).  The transit depths from the AD(λ) and light-curve ﬁt anal- yses should be similar, although we expect systematic vari- ations. Since some data points in F3 and F4 occur during transit ingress and egress, the AD depths are expected to be  20.017.515.012.5Visit 11.00.50.00.523002400250026002700280029003000Wavelength (angstrom)17.515.012.5Visit 21.00.50.00.5Radial velocity (kms1)Offset in pixels07142128354249Frame number20.017.515.012.5Visit 11.00.50.00.5010203040Frame number17.515.012.5Visit 21.00.50.00.5Radial velocity (kms1)Offset in pixels036912151821Echelle order6  CUBILLOS et al.  lower than the light-curve ﬁt depths. Additionally, the AD analysis does not account for stellar limb darkening. Never- theless, we ﬁnd a good agreement between the transit depths obtained from the light-curve ﬁt and the AD method (see, e.g., Figure 5). Both methods produce similar uncertainties, and their transit-depth values agree within 1σ of each other for most spectral channels.  4. Atmospheric Signatures  Both spectral analyses of the HD 209458 b NUV obser- vations suggest that the planet has a nearly ﬂat transmission spectrum. The high-resolution analyses show scattered ab- sorption features across the spectrum; however, the limited S/N of the data complicates the detection of individual fea- tures. Here, we describe the analysis carried out to detect at- mospheric features and discuss their physical interpretation.  4.1. Identiﬁcation of Absorption Lines  The high-resolution transmission spectrum of HD 209458 b (i.e., at 25 km s−1) shows a large number of data points that deviate signiﬁcantly above the continuum (i.e., the low- resolution spectrum at 1000 km s−1). While from a normal distribution of 3600 data points one expects ∼10 outliers deviating more than 3σ above and below the mean, we typ- ically ﬁnd ∼25 data points deviating above the continuum by more than three times their uncertainty, suggesting that most of them are likely absorption features rising from the planetary atmosphere.  To determine whether we can associate these outliers to a particular atomic absorption line, we apply the probabilistic approach of Haswell et al. (2012). Using the VALD database for the atomic line transitions (Piskunov et al. 1995) and adopting solar elemental abundances (Asplund et al. 2009), we collect all known atomic line transitions within a given wavelength range (∆λ) around each candidate absorption feature (i.e., outlier) lying at wavelength λ0. To each known line transition i at wavelength λi we assign a “match” prob- ability based on their proximity to λ0, elemental abundance (nj), and line strength (determined by the values of the tran- sition probability gfi, by the energy of the lower level Ei (in cm−1) of the transition, and by the temperature of the low atmospheric layers probed by the observations T ) as  P (cid:48) i =  |λi − λ0|  ∆λ  nj gfi exp(  −hcEi kT  low  ),  (4)  i /(cid:80) P (cid:48)  where h and k are respectively Planck’s and Boltzmann’s constants, and c is the speed of light. Finally, we normalize all match probabilities to obtain a discrete probability distri- bution: Pi ≡ P (cid:48) i . Thus, by ﬁnding the line transitions with a high match probability (Pi > 68.3%, in this case), this framework reveals how likely it is for a speciﬁc line transition to be the unambiguous source of one of the 3σ outliers. Here, we consider a window of ∆λ = 2.5 Å, which corresponds to a velocity of about 275 km s−1, and adopt an atmospheric temperature of T = 10 000 K (e.g., Koskinen et al. 2013a).  We ﬁnd that many of the outliers in the HD 209458 b NUV data can be associated with Fe+ absorption lines, at  the Pi > 68.3% level, three outliers can be associated with Fe, and one with Mg+. Figure 3 shows the derived transmis- sion spectrum at a resolution of 25 km s−1 highlighting the position of the deviating data-points, further associating them with the identiﬁed line transitions. On the top of each panel, we mark the positions of other lines of the Fe, Fe+, and Mg+ ions that should be stronger than the identiﬁed ones. Note that this analysis implicitly assumes local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE), while non-LTE effects are expected to play a signiﬁcant role in the atmospheric layers probed by the observations. Therefore, the marks on the top of each panel in Figure 3 should be considered to be only indicative. Figure 3 further compares the observed transmission spec- trum to a theoretical model spectrum of HD 209458 b (see Section 4.2). As expected from the line-identiﬁcation analy- sis, many Fe+ lines present in the model spectrum correlate with the location of outliers identiﬁed as Fe+ features by the probabilistic approach presented above. Since our high-resolution binning of 25 km s−1 is larger than the instrumental resolving element (10 km s−1, the span of two pixels), there is an arbitrariness in the selection of the bin edges. Therefore, to conﬁrm the robustness of our detections, we repeated the line-identiﬁcation analysis four more times, shifting the bin locations by half the instrumen- tal resolving element each time (i.e., a total of ﬁve iterations shifted by 5 km s−1 from each other); this is similar to the analysis of Spake et al. (2018). In Figure 3 we use a differ- ent symbol to mark the 3σ outliers at each shift. The colored markers denote the lines identiﬁed at multiple shifts, whereas the dark-gray markers denote the lines identiﬁed at a single shift location.  The most robust features that we detect are a set of ab- sorption features between 2330 and 2420 Å, consistent with a Fe+ band. Most of these features appear at three or more different shifts, reassuring us that these are not artifacts re- sulting from the data analysis. We also ﬁnd a large number of ‘unknown’ absorption features. Note that by ‘unknown’, we do not mean that there are no known line transitions at the location of the outlier, rather that there is no unique line transition unambiguously associated with the observed fea- ture. We do not detect any 3σ outliers near the Mg line at 2850 Å. The Mg+ doublet at 2800 Å is interesting, because we only ﬁnd a recurring absorption feature redward of the Mg+ h line, but not near the Mg+ k line. This is conﬂicting, since the two magnesium lines have similar strengths (Mg+ h being slightly weaker), and thus the data should show both features. Given that we observe a Mg+ h feature only at two shifts, and that we do not detect any feature around the Mg+ k line, we conclude that this does not constitute a robust de- tection of magnesium.  4.2.

We adopt temperature, and radius) from existing models of HD 209458 b and as- sume solar abundances for heavy elements.

The green dots with error bars connected by a solid line denote the observed spectrum at a resolution of 1000 km s−1, which we adopted as the continuum baseline. The circle, star, square, diamond, and triangle markers with error bars denote the 3σ outliers at each of the shifts (see text).

The vertical-line marks at the top denote all line transitions for a given ion, with line strengths larger than the detected features in the data (same color code as in the legend). We also marked in orange the four strongest Si line transitions at 2510–2530 and 2880 Å, since they lay close to two absorption features, though our algorithm cannot uniquely associate them to Si.

We feed these ray proﬁles into CLOUDY to pro- duce individual transmission spectra for each ray. Finally, we compute the total integrated transmission spectrum as the sum of the individual spectra, weighted by the annular area at the given impact parameter, assuming azimuthal symme- try around the terminator. We set the density proﬁles to zero at the Roche-lobe boundary because 1D atmospheric proﬁles are not valid above it. Therefore, the predicted strength of the absorption for the lines reaching the Roche-lobe bound- ary should be considered to be a lower limit, as the model itself clearly indicates substantial escape beyond the Roche lobe. We note that CLOUDY includes an extensive database of line transitions and includes options for both LTE and non- LTE level populations.  The key assumption of this work is that heavy magnesium and iron atoms with their ions are dragged along by the es- caping lighter hydrogen atoms and protons so that they have roughly solar abundances in the upper-atmosphere part of the CLOUDY model. We used the escape model of Kosk- inen et al. (2013a) to validate this assumption for magne- sium (Figure 4). This model does not currently include iron, a much more complex species, but the mass-loss rate from HD 209458 b is predicted to be sufﬁciently high to mix iron to high altitudes where CLOUDY is used to calculate its ion- ization balance and transmission in Fe and Fe+ lines. For magnesium, we show transmission based on the density pro- ﬁles predicted by the escape model in Figure 5. We note that outﬂow can alter the ionization balance of metal absorbers and, in particular, enhance absorption by neutrals, whereas the current version of CLOUDY assumes a static atmosphere when calculating the ionization balance. Therefore, it will eventually also be necessary to study the escape of iron in detail and our modeling results in Figure 3 should be treated with some caution, although we consider them perfectly suf- ﬁcient for a preliminary interpretation of observations.  5. Results  The model continuum, based on H2 and He Rayleigh scattering, is consistent with the observed baseline (Fig. 3), though the scatter does not allow to constrain the Rayleigh slope.  This data alone does not allow us to distinguish between a clear or cloudy atmosphere. Doing this would require ad- ditional NUV observation, a broader wavelength coverage, or both. We will address this issue from a theoretical point of view, in a future work. From the optical and infrared ob- servations, it is still under debate whether HD 209458 b has a cloudy or partially cloudy atmosphere (e.g., Deming et al. 2013; Madhusudhan et al. 2014; Sing et al. 2016; MacDon- ald & Madhusudhan 2017; Pinhas et al. 2019). We acknowl- edge that the NUV continuum may also include molecular absorbers (e.g., Evans et al. 2018) below the noise level, but the data do not support the detection of any such absorber.  In line with its low ionization potential, Mg in our mod- els is ionized near the 1 µbar pressure level (see Figure 1 in Koskinen et al. 2014), so that Mg+ and Fe+ are the domi-  Figure 4. HD 209458 b model atmospheric proﬁles for the temperature and electron-density (top panel), and the magnesium number density (bot- tom panel). The proﬁles here extend from the 1 bar level to the Roche-lobe boundary (r ≈ 3Rp). Since the sound speed barrier is crossed around the Roche lobe surface, these proﬁles are causally separated from the space above, and thus, unaffected by the physics above the Roche lobe. Extend- ing the 1D model proﬁles beyond the Roche lobe would overestimate the number density, due to lack of 3D effects in our model; the densities should probably decrease faster with distance from the planet. Therefore we capped the densities at the Roche lobe to produce the transmission spectrum model shown in Fig. 3.  atmosphere, we use the dayside temperature–pressure pro- ﬁle from Showman et al. (2009). For the upper atmosphere (Figure 4), we couple the lower-atmosphere proﬁle to the model of Koskinen et al. (2013a). We then use the spectral- synthesis and radiative-transfer code CLOUDY (version 17, Ferland et al. 2017) to calculate ion densities for a static at- mosphere and the resulting transmission spectrum, including the parent neutral species of H, H2, He, Na, Mg and Fe in the model (Figure 3).  As the computation of the synthetic transmission spectrum with CLOUDY is yet to be published (Young et al., in prepa- ration), we summarize the procedure here. Starting from the radial 1D planetary atmosphere model, we map the altitude, temperature, and abundance proﬁles onto concentric, spher- ically symmetric shells. Next, we deﬁne an array of paral- lel ‘transmission’ rays, along the star–observer line of sight, as a function of the planetary impact parameter. Then, we track when each ray crosses each atmospheric layer of the  NUV TRANSMISSION SPECTROSCOPY OF HD 209458 B  9  tected absorption features at the location of a dozen of strong Fe+ lines. However, the match is not perfect, as there are a few strong Fe+ lines without a detected counterpart. More puzzling is that the data does not show robustly detected features at 2600 Å, where there is another complex of Fe+ lines that are as strong as those at 2400 Å. Interestingly, the WASP-121b NUV transmission spectrum reported by Sing et al. (2019), observed with the same instrument and detec- tor, also shows a similar trend. There are numerous other observed absorption features that are too weak to claim a de- tection (S/N < 3σ), or are not consistently detected at multi- ple shifts.  Certainly, better calculations of the density proﬁles, ex- tending beyond the Roche lobe, are required to constrain the physical conditions of the upper atmosphere and escape. Even with these limitations, however, the model demon- strates that the magnitude of the detected Fe+ transit depths is consistent with escape models for the atmosphere of HD 209458 b, provided that iron is not removed from the upper atmosphere by condensation (see, e.g., Lavvas et al. 2014). This case is similar to that of WASP-121, where, if the NUV excess absorption is real, it is most likely caused by Fe+ (Salz et al. 2019).  5.1. Comparison with Vidal-Madjar et al. (2013)  Our analysis beneﬁts from advances in data analysis that the transiting-exoplanet community has experienced over the past decade. In particular, we applied techniques that were not available or widely used in the ﬁeld at the time of Vidal- Madjar et al. (2013), which allowed us to analyze this dataset in new light. In the ﬁrst place, the divide-white analysis of- fers an alternative route to extract the wavelength-dependent transit depths (as opposed to the AD(λ) method). Second, the Bayesian MCMC analysis allowed us to estimate more robust transit-depth uncertainties. Lastly, the wavelength cal- ibration of the signiﬁcant radial-velocity shifts over time and wavelength, might have an impact on the results as well. Given these different approaches, and other low-level details in the data analysis, it can be expected that our results differ from those of Vidal-Madjar et al. (2013).  Interestingly, our conclusions for the broad-band analysis agree well with those of Vidal-Madjar et al. (2013), both ﬁnd- ing a baseline transit depth of 1.44% (Rp/Rs ∼ 0.12), where the ﬁrst two HST visits agree with each other, and the third visit presents much stronger systematics (in ﬂux as well as in wavelength calibration).  Regarding the high-resolution analysis of the spectral fea- tures, the detection of the Mg absorption feature by Vidal- Madjar et al. (2013), absent in our re-analysis, remains the main discrepancy. Although we do ﬁnd excess-absorption features at transit-depth levels of ∼6% (Rp/Rs ∼ 0.24) around the location of the Mg line (see Figure 5), these are not signiﬁcant at the 3σ level (consistent with the 2.1σ re- sult of Vidal-Madjar et al. 2013). Our further exploration of the NUV transmission spectrum allowed us to identify a se- ries of data points with increased absorption deviating more  Figure 5.

This is comparable, for example, with the detection of ionized magnesium and iron in the lower ionosphere of the Earth (Plane et al. 2015).  Figure 5 compares the magnesium absorption signatures predicted by our escape model with our transmission spec- tra of HD 209458 b for the resonant Mg+ h&k lines at about 2800 Å and Mg line at about 2850 Å. In this ﬁgure, the curve shows the model spectra where the abundances extend be- yond the Roche lobe. This is an overestimation, because it does not account for the asymmetric 3D distribution of the material beyond the planet’s Roche lobe. If the planet had a magnesium overﬂow beyond the Roche lobe, both Mg+ lines should have been observed, given the assumed magne- sium density proﬁle. However, we do not consistently detect a signiﬁcant magnesium signature in the data (greater than 3σ), at any of the considered resolving powers, neither from Mg nor Mg+.  Our analysis supports the detection of many individual lines (Figure 3). The best match occurs between 2325 and 2420 Å, where the observed spectrum shows robustly de-  Wavelength (A)0.00.10.20.30.4Rp/RsWavelength (A)25 km/sWavelength (A)0.00.10.20.30.4Rp/RsWavelength (A)50 km/s279528002805Wavelength (A)0.00.10.20.30.4Rp/Rs2850285228542856Wavelength (A)100 km/s10  CUBILLOS et al.  than 3σ above the continuum, where many of them could be associated to Fe+ line transitions.  5.2. Broader Impact: Connection to Lower Atmosphere and  FUV Observations  Although our results resolve the tension given by the pre- vious detection of Mg and non-detection of Mg+, in princi- ple, they pose a new challenge. Lower-atmosphere modeling of HD 209458 b indicate that iron and magnesium-bearing cloud condensation curves lie close enough to each other that if Mg condenses into clouds, then Fe should also con- dense (e.g., Lavvas et al. 2014), in direct contrast with our results. Recently, using an aerosol microphysics model to directly compute nucleation and condensation rates, Gao et al. (submitted) ﬁnd that magnesium-silicate clouds dominate the aerosol opacity at planetary equilibrium temperatures of HD 209458 b. The higher nucleation energy barrier of iron condensates prevents signiﬁcant amounts of iron cloud for- mation, compared to magnesium-silicates, even though there is as much iron as silicon or magnesium available in the at- mosphere. Therefore, this microphysics model offers a theo- retical framework consistent with our results.  In relationship to the FUV observations, Shaikhislamov et al. (submitted) performed three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of the upper atmosphere and circumplanetary en- vironment of HD 209458 b. They obtained that to ﬁt the 8% FUV transit-depth absorption by Si2+ observed by Lin- sky et al. (2010), they need to decrease the silicon abun- dance to nearly ten times smaller than solar. Assuming that the clouds are composed mostly of enstatite (MgSiO3) or forsterite (Mg2SiO4), there would be at least as much magne- sium as silicon locked into condensates. Hence, with a mag- nesium abundance of 0.1 times solar, they estimate a magne- sium transit-depth absorption of only 2%, which is compati- ble with the (non-detection) observations presented here.  6. Conclusions  We re-analyzed the NUV transmission spectroscopy ob- servations of HD 209458 b presented by Vidal-Madjar et al. (2013) making use of the improved knowledge and experi- ence in handing systematic noise gathered in recent years in the exoplanet community. The detection of Mg and non- detection of Mg+ presented by Vidal-Madjar et al. (2013) posed a challenge to the exoplanet atmospheric modeling community, which could not be solved simply by considering Mg recombination (see also Shaikhislamov et al. 2018, for a discussion on this topic). Furthermore, theoretical models predict the presence of a large number of metallic transition lines in the NUV spectrum. These considerations led us to this re-analysis.  We employed a two-step analysis: ﬁrst, identifying the instrumental systematics from the wavelength-integrated light curves; and then, extracting the wavelength-dependent transmission spectrum from the systematics-corrected light curves. We implemented two independent spectral analyses, leading to comparable results. Our transmission spectra in- dicate the presence of absorption features extending beyond  the Roche-lobe boundary at wavelengths below ∼2500 Å, with the strongest absorption concentrating around ∼2400 Å. A probabilistic line-identiﬁcation approach (Haswell et al. 2012), and direct comparisons to theoretical models indi- cate that the detected absorption features are most probably caused by Fe+ line transitions. This requires for iron atoms to be lifted beyond the planet’s Roche lobe; for example, en- trained in the hydrodynamic expansion of the atmosphere by collisions with hydrogen atoms (e.g., Koskinen et al. 2014). We also ﬁnd no robust evidence of either Mg or Mg+ absorp- tion in the planetary upper atmosphere, though, if present at the same altitudes as Fe+, the data would enable us to detect it. There are plausible absorption features around the Mg+ h line; however, the data shows no companion features at a similar shift around the equally-strong Mg+ k line. In agree- ment with Vidal-Madjar et al. (2013), we ﬁnd that the NUV continuum absorption is consistent with Rayleigh scattering. Line broadening from natural and Doppler broaden- ing (FWHM of ∼3 km s−1), planetary rotational velocity (2 km s−1), wind velocities (2 km s−1, Snellen et al. 2010), and escape velocity (1–10 km s−1, Koskinen et al. 2013a) is small compared to the spectral bin size of 25 km s−1 adopted in our analysis. However, the radial component of the planet’s orbital velocity changes from the beginning to the end of the transit by ∼30 km s−1 (Snellen et al. 2010), which can make the absorption features to appear weaker in the analysis. By repeating the spectral light-curve ﬁtting at multiple sub-bin shifts (5 km s−1), we mitigate ill-posed sce- narios where a line might fall near the edge of a bin. We will directly account for the orbital radial-velocity shift in a future study using the high-resolution cross-correlation technique (in prep.).  By not ﬁnding any robust detection of magnesium in the upper atmosphere, our results resolve the conundrum pre- sented by Vidal-Madjar et al. (2013). Furthermore, recent state-of-the-art microphysics models suggest that cloud for- mation can largely favor the formation of magnesium (and therefore, sequestering) over iron condensates in the lower atmosphere, providing a plausible theoretical interpretation of our results.  The upper-atmosphere models that we employed are based on an appropriate hydrodynamic framework and chemical network, but they adopt a one-dimensional parameterization of the atmosphere, thus limiting our capability to use the observations to ﬁrmly constrain the physical conditions of the upper atmosphere and escape. More complex models, accounting for all relevant physical effects (e.g., the three- dimensional dynamics that the material follow beyond the Roche-lobe boundary) are required to best exploit the already available and future observations.  Previous (Vidal-Madjar et al. 2013) and our own analysis of the observed NUV transmission spectrum of HD 209458 b have revealed challenges to upper-atmosphere models, as well as results from lower-atmosphere observations. Hav- ing the possibility to observe both the upper- and lower- atmosphere of an exoplanet highlights the value of a holistic characterization of exoplanet atmospheres. This and other  NUV TRANSMISSION SPECTROSCOPY OF HD 209458 B  11  contemporary NUV studies (e.g., Sing et al. 2019) show that this is possible.  The close-in orbit, large radius, and bright host star of HD 209458 b give this planet a pivotal role for exoplanet at- mospheric characterization. Few other planets will ever en- able such precise measurements of their upper- and lower- atmosphere properties. Thus, a better understanding of the upper-atmosphere of this important target would prove to be particularly useful, especially before the imminent launch of the James Webb Space Telescope. While we robustly de- tected several absorption features matching Fe+ transition lines on HD 209458 b (at a S/N > 3σ), there are many other weaker features in the spectrum. If the features that we see are of astrophysical nature, further NUV observations could potentially uncover from dozens to hundreds of additional Fe and Fe+ features, and place stronger constraints to the strength of the Mg and Mg+ lines (if present at all). Data of the necessary quality could only be currently obtained with HST.  A dedicated mission for UV spectroscopic observations, such as the Colorado Ultraviolet Transit Experiment (CUTE, Fleming et al. 2018), is therefore an efﬁcient way to col- lect NUV observations to prove or disprove the presence of magnesium in the upper atmosphere. The combined CUTE and HST data will enable a ﬁrm interpretation of the results, and provide solid constraints to lower and upper atmosphere modeling.  This work demonstrates the need for comparative analy- ses of archival data sets with full transparency and for re- peated observations of the same target aiming at improving data quality, transit light curve coverage, and robustness of the results against instrumental and astrophysical noise.

Light-curve observations (markers with error bars) and best-ﬁt model (black curves) for each visit (left to right panels) and spectral order (top to bottom curves). The shaded gray area denote the span of models for the 0.68-quantile from the MCMC posterior distribution. The numbers below each model show the reduced chi-squared (χ2  ν) for each light curve. The numbers above each model on the right panel show the central wavelength of each spectral order.  0.060.030.000.03Orbitalphase0.40.50.60.70.80.91.0(Rp/Rs)22=1.001.541.841.351.271.441.271.940.901.341.431.141.431.510.830.691.481.230.831.030.611.160.820.060.030.000.03Orbitalphase2=1.252.511.181.461.250.870.961.091.281.471.740.991.480.670.631.141.091.281.281.361.390.9815.470.060.030.000.03Orbitalphase2=5.213047A4.933002A3.212959A5.262917A3.452875A2.522835A1.212797A1.612759A1.702722A1.782686A1.792651A1.402617A1.762584A1.302552A1.332520A1.362489A1.402459A1.812430A1.292402A1.712374A1.492346A1.022320A1.132293A14  CUBILLOS et al.
