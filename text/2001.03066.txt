Received 2019 December 13; In original form 2019 August 24;  ABSTRACT Binary systems exert a gravitational torque on misaligned discs orbiting them, causing diﬀerential precession which may produce disc warping and tearing. While this is well understood for gas-only discs, misaligned cirumbinary discs of gas and dust have not been thoroughly investigated. We perform SPH simulations of misaligned gas and dust discs around binaries to investigate the diﬀerent evolution of these two components. We choose two diﬀerent disc aspect ratios: A thin case for which the gas disc always breaks, and a thick one where a smooth warp develops throughout the disc. For each case, we run simulations of ﬁve diﬀerent dust species with diﬀerent degrees of coupling with the gas component, varying in Stokes number from 0.002 (strongly coupled dust) to 1000 (eﬀectively decoupled dust). We report two new phenomena: First, large dust grains in thick discs pile up at the warp location, forming narrow dust rings, due to a diﬀerence in precession between the gas and dust components. These pile ups do not form at gas pressure maxima, and hence are diﬀerent from conventional dust traps. This eﬀect is most evident for St ∼ 10 - 100. Second, thin discs tear and break only in the gas, while dust particles with St (cid:62) 10 form a dense dust trap due to the steep pressure gradient caused by the break in the gas. We ﬁnd that dust with St (cid:54) 0.02 closely follow the gas particles, for both thin and thick discs, with radial drift becoming noticeable only for the largest grains in this range.

Many of them form in binary or multiple systems. Conservation of angular momentum pre- dicts the formation of ﬂattened discs as the molecular cloud core collapses. These discs of gas and dust are thought to be the location where planet formation takes place. For close bi- nary systems, we expect circumbinary discs to form. Recent observations of circumbinary planets conﬁrm these expec- tations (Doyle et al. 2011; Welsh et al. 2012; Orosz et al. 2012b,a; Welsh et al. 2015; Kostov et al. 2013, 2016).  Due to the random nature of star formation (Bonnell & Bastien 1992; Oﬀner et al. 2010; Bate et al. 2010; Bate 2018), at least some circumbinary discs are expected to form misaligned to the binary orbital plane. These expectations have been conﬁrmed by recent observations; for example GG Tau A (K¨ohler 2011; Andrews et al. 2014; Aly et al. 2018), KH 15D (Chiang & Murray-Clay 2004; Winn et al.  (cid:63) Email: hossam.aly@gmail.com  © 2019 The Authors  2004; Lodato & Facchini 2013; Smallwood et al. 2019; Fang et al. 2019), IRS 43 (Brinch et al. 2016), and L1551 NE (Takakuwa et al. 2017). Stellar binaries exert gravitational torques on inclined circumbinary discs causing radially dif- ferential precession. In the presence of dissipation, diﬀeren- tial precession will cause the evolution of warps within the disc which can either diﬀuse or propagate in a wave-like man- ner depending on disc thickness and viscosity (Papaloizou & Pringle 1983; Papaloizou & Lin 1995; Ogilvie 1999; Lodato & Pringle 2007; Lodato & Price 2010). Dissipation and warp evolution lead to planar alignment of the disc with respect to the binary orbital plane, either in a prograde or retro- grade sense depending on the initial inclination (King et al. 2005; Nixon et al. 2011), with a possibility of tearing the disc whenever the gravitational torque exceeds the viscous torque (Nixon et al. 2013; Doˇgan et al. 2018). For inclined low mass discs around eccentric binaries, polar alignment is possible (Farago & Laskar 2010; Aly et al. 2015; Martin & Lubow 2017; Zanazzi & Lai 2018), a conﬁguration that has been recently observed in the HD98800 system (Kennedy et al. 2019).  2  Hossam Aly & Giuseppe Lodato  While recent studies have explored the evolution of in- clined gas discs around binaries, the interplay between gas and dust in such an environment is yet to be fully explored. The standard theory for planet formation is the well known ‘core accretion’ theory (Safronov 1969; Goldreich & Ward 1973). In this context, a metal rich core forms and grows through collision of planetesimals up to a point where it reaches a high enough mass for runaway gas accretion to take place. In this scenario, dust grains must grow through coagulation and clumping from micron sizes up to kilometer size planetesimals (Testi et al. 2014). However, this growth is thought to be hampered by the radial drift of dust par- ticles caused by drag forces (Whipple 1972; Adachi et al. 1976; Weidenschilling 1977). This radial drift of dust parti- cles is caused by the the velocity diﬀerence between the gas and dust components: while dust particles orbit at Keplerian speed, gas experiences an outward pressure gradient causing it to orbit at sub-Keplerian speed. This velocity diﬀerence causes a head wind on the dust particles causing them to drift inwards. This is the so called ‘meter sized barrier’ prob- lem to planet formation, although the naming came about as this was ﬁrst applied to a Minimum Mass Solar Nebula (MMSN), for which the critical size dust particles are close 1 meter. A more general way of identifying critical dust sizes is by making use of the Stokes number St, as the ratio of the stopping time to the orbital time:  St = Ωkτs  (1)  Where Ωk is the keplerian angular speed and τs is the char- acteristic stopping time, which is a measure of the coupling due to the drag force. For typical protoplanetary discs and particle sizes less than 1 meter, The gas mean free path is much larger than the dust particle size (λg/s (cid:54) 4/9, where λg is the gas mean free path and s is the dust particle size) and the drag force is well described by the Epstein regime (Epstein 1924). In this regime the stopping time can be de- scribed by ρds ρgvth  vth = (cid:112)8/πcs id the mean thermal velocity and cs is the  where ρd is the dust intrinsic density, ρg is the gas density,  τs =  (2)  sound speed. The Stokes number then becomes  St =  π 2  ρds Σg  (3)  with Σg denoting the gas surface density. Particles with St ∼ 1 experience the strongest radial drift (Brauer et al. 2007). This has severe implications on planet formation; namely, mm-cm sized grains drift inwards within a small fraction of the disc lifetime before planetesimals can form.  A proposed solution to the radial drift barrier to planet formation is that dust particles get trapped in gas local pres- sure maxima (Nakagawa et al. 1986). Indeed the drift veloc- ity vanishes exactly when the pressure gradient is zero. A few mechanisms were suggested to form these dust traps, such as vortices (Barge & Sommeria 1995; Klahr & Henning 1997), gaps forged by planets (Paardekooper & Mellema 2004; Pinilla et al. 2012), spirals induced by gravitational instabilities (Rice et al. 2004, 2006) and self induced dust traps when taking into account the dust backreaction on the gas as well as dust growth and fragmentation (Gonzalez et al. 2017).  In this paper, we study the interaction between gas and dust in inclined circumbinary discs. We investigate the ef- fects of the resulting precession and induced warps on the dust evolution and whether this could oﬀer a solution to the radial drift problem. We perform Smoothed Particle Hy- drodynamics (SPH) simulations of misaligned gas and dust discs around an equal mass circular binary, varying the dust St and disc aspect ratio. We present the details of the nu- merical simulations in Section 2. In Section 3 we show and discuss our results for large dust particles and discuss how these can be connected with observations in Section 4. We then present our results for small dust grains in Section 5 before we conclude our ﬁndings in Section 6.  2 HYDRODYNAMIC SIMULATIONS  We perform a suite of numerical simulations using the SPH code PHANTOM (Price et al. 2018). PHANTOM imple- ments two diﬀerent ways for treating gas-dust mixtures: a two-ﬂuid model for large (St (cid:62) 1) dust particles and a one- ﬂuid model for small (St < 1) dust grains. In the two-ﬂuid model (Laibe & Price 2012), the two species are treated with two diﬀerent sets of particles which carry information about the properties of their corresponding type. The usual SPH density summation is carried out over neighbours of the same particle type. Two sets of governing equations are solved and a drag term is added to account for the inter- action between gas and dust. The drag term uses a ‘double hump’ kernel, in contrast to the usual SPH kernel implemen- tation (details of the algorithm can be found in Price et al. (2018) and Laibe & Price (2012)). The algorithm computes the Knudsen number  Kn =  9λg 4s  (4)  where λg is the gas mean free path and s is the grain size. A drag regime is selected automatically based on the particle Kn; Epstein drag (Kwok 1975) is computed for particles with Kn (cid:62) 1 and Stokes drag is computed for Kn < 1, with a smooth transition between the two regimes. Importantly, the code calculates the stopping time – a measure of the decay of the diﬀerential velocity between the two phases due to the drag force – between a dust–gas particles pair according to:  tstop =  ρgρd  K(ρg + ρd)  (5)  Where K is a drag coeﬃcient depending on the drag regime. The timestep is governed by the stopping time between two particles, making the two-ﬂuid model extremely computa- tionally expensive for low St simulations.  In the one-ﬂuid model, on the other hand, both dust and gas are treated as one mixture with the same set of governing equations, with an evolution equation for the dust fraction. In this method, the timestep is governed by the inverse of the stopping time, which becomes computationally expensive in the large dust particle regime, where the two-ﬂuid model is more appropriate (Price & Laibe 2015). This algorithm has been used and veriﬁed extensively in previous studies, for example in Dipierro et al. (2015); Tricco et al. (2017); Ragusa et al. (2017); Nealon et al. (2019).  We perform simulations for 5 dust species spaning a  MNRAS 000, 1–11 (2019)  Eﬃcient dust ring formation in misaligned circumbinary discs  3  H/R Approx St Dust Model  End Time (in binary orbits)  3 LARGE DUST GRAINS  0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.05 0.05 0.05 0.05 0.05  10 100 1000 0.02 0.002  10 100 1000 0.02 0.002  2-ﬂuid 2-ﬂuid 2-ﬂuid 1-ﬂuid 1-ﬂuid 2-ﬂuid 2-ﬂuid 2-ﬂuid 1-ﬂuid 1-ﬂuid  900 900 870 1000 1000 150 500 500 1000 1000  Table 1. Parameters set for the simulations suite  wide range of St. For each dust species, we perform 2 sim- ulations with a thick H/R = 0.1 and thin H/R = 0.05 disc aspect ratio at the inner radius. In all our simulations, We use a disc viscosity coeﬃcient (Shakura & Sunyaev 1973) α = 0.01. The binary stars are modeled using equal mass sink particles with a total mass of 1 M(cid:12) and accretion ra- dius of racc = 0.5a, where a is the binary separation. The discs extend from Rin = 1.5a to Rout = 15a and are ini- tially ﬂat with an inclination of Θ = 30 and a total (gas + dust) mass of 0.02 M(cid:12), with a dust to gas ratio 0f 0.01. All our simulations are safely with the gravitational stable regime, therefore we do not employ self gravity in any of these computations. In all our simulations we use a gas density radial proﬁle as a power law with an index p = −1.5. We assume a lo- cally isothermal disc, where the sound speed cs varies only with disc radius as power law with an index of q = −0.75. This choice of parameters ensures that the disc is uniformly resolved at least initially (Lodato & Price 2010) and that the resulting physical viscosity coeﬃcient is constant with radius. The sound speed power law also implies an aspect ratio radial proﬁle H/R ∝ R−1/4. We use 1 million SPH gas particles, ensuring that the disc thickness is resolved by sev- eral smoothing length at any radius. For the high St cases modeled with the 2-ﬂuid approach, we represent the dust with 300,000 particles. The thick disc cases as well as all the cases with the 1-ﬂuid model ran for more than 900 binary orbits (∼ 3 × 104 years). Cases with thin discs underwent disc breaking and tearing which caused a substantial decrease in the time step and hence more computational wall time. Nevertheless most of these simulations ran for more 500 binary orbits. We summarize all the simulations parameters as well as the ﬁnal time in Table 1.  It will be useful to deﬁne the two angles deﬁning a warped disc, that is the tilt and twist angles. If we deﬁne as ˆl the unit vector corresponding to the disc angular momen- tum (deﬁning the direction perpendicular to the local disc plane), we have that (e.g., see Facchini et al. 2013):  ˆl = (cos β sin Θ, sin β sin Θ, cos Θ),  (6)  where Θ is the tilt angle and β is the twist angle. A disc is warped whenever Θ varies with radius, and is twisted whenever additionally β varies with radius.  MNRAS 000, 1–11 (2019)  In this Section we ﬁrst present the results obtained with weakly coupled dust grains, with St > 1, in the two gas conﬁgurations of a thick (H/R = 0.1) and thin (H/R = 0.05) disc. Strongly coupled dust simulations are presented later in Section 5.  3.1 Thick discs  We present the surface density, twist, and tilt radial proﬁles at 4 diﬀerent times for the H/R = 0.1 and St ∼ 10, 100, and 1000 cases (top to bottom) in Fig. 1. Starting with the top row (St = 10), the surface density proﬁle shows a dust pile up in the inner disc at R ∼ 3a, with another less pro- nounced bump at R ∼ 8a. We note that neither of these dust pile ups occur at gas density peaks, implying that the underlying mechanism is not the usual trapping at pressure maxima. The middle panel shows the twist angle radial pro- ﬁle for the same 4 snapshots. Here we can clearly see that the gas and dust precess at diﬀerent rates. The gas disc, which communicates viscously with the outer disc, tends to precess almost rigidly with only a few degrees diﬀerence in the twist angle between the inner and outer parts of the disc. The dust on the other hand does not communicate viscously, and can only experience the binary gravitational torque cause the diﬀerential precession, as well as the drag force from the gas component. Hence the dust displays a greater radial gradient in precession rate, with the inner part leading the gas disc and the outer part lagging behind the gas. The precession proﬁle shows the gas and dust are out of phase for most of the radial extent of the disc. We can see that the intersection of the twist proﬁles occurs at R ∼ 5.5a. This coincides with a dip in the dust surface density proﬁle shown in the up- per left panel. This means that the intersection between the gas and dust discs produces a head wind on the dust par- ticles that causes radial drift at this radius. However, when dust particles migrate inwards, they go out of phase with the gas and pile up because of the reduced drag force. The right panel shows the tilt angle radial proﬁle for the gas and dust. We see that the gas smoothly aligns with the binary plane with only a few degrees of warping between the in- ner and outer parts of the disc. The dust however shows a larger variation in the tilt proﬁle between small and large radii. Fig. 2 compares the gas and dust column density in the xy-plane (top) and xz-plane (bottom) after ∼ 900 bi- nary orbits. The diﬀerent twist and tilt proﬁles between gas and dust are visible as well as the dust pile ups. The second row of Fig. 1 shows the same radial proﬁles for the St ∼ 100 case and H/R = 0.1. We note that the twist angle radial proﬁles show the same trend as the St = 10 case. However, we notice that both the dip and subsequent pile in the dust surface density proﬁle are less prominent. This is due to the fact that larger dust grains are less aﬀected by the drag force exerted by the gas. Indeed, the third row of Fig. 1 shows the same radial proﬁles for the largest grain size we simulate in this paper St ∼ 1000, that are essentially decoupled from the gas. We can see that the eﬀects on the dust surface density proﬁle diminished even further.  The second and third row in Fig. 1 show tilt oscillations that start at the inner discs and grow and propagate with time (more evident in the St ∼ 1000 case). In order to un-  4  Hossam Aly & Giuseppe Lodato  Figure 1.

Gas and dust are repre- sented by blue and red particles, respectively. The oscilla- tions are completely absent in the St ∼ 10 case and increase with the grain size. We see that dust particles at the inner edge are perturbed by the binary. These perturbations grow and propagate through the disc when the dust particles are large enough not to be aﬀected by the drag force, while they are damped quickly for grains closer to marginal coupling.  The eventual result of these perturbations is to gradually transform the dust disc to a spherical cloud above a certain grain size (ﬁnal snapshot for the St ∼ 1000 case is shown in Fig. 4). The dependence of the growth and extent of these oscillations on the St number as well as the initial surface density proﬁles is going to be investigated in a future study.  The cross sections in Fig. 3 also help visualize the dif- ferent precession evolution of the gas and dust discs. We can see that the fourth panel in each case (after 150 binary orbits) the gas and dust discs are already out of phase, re- sulting in the dips and pile ups shown in the radial proﬁles in Fig. 1.  MNRAS 000, 1–11 (2019)  Eﬃcient dust ring formation in misaligned circumbinary discs  5  The immediate consequence of a break in the gas disc is the lack of viscous communication between inner and outer radii: the inner disc breaks and precesses much faster with- out having to ‘pull’ the outer disc around. This is in strike contrast to the mechanism operating for thick discs reported in the previous section. Fig. 5 shows the gas and dust den- sity columns for the St ∼ 10 case (top: X-Y plane, bottom: X-Z plane). We can see that the gas disc breaks and the in- ner part precesses independently. The dust has a smoother proﬁle than the gas with no sharp breaks. We note that the outer dust and gas discs remain in-phase since here the gas disc does not precess rigidly after the inner part breaks. We also see a ring of dust at higher density forming in the inner dust disc.  In Fig. 6 we plot the radial proﬁles of surface density, twist and tilt angles for both dust and gas for for the three diﬀerent St corresponding to the large dust grains (same as Fig. 1 but for the thin disc). Starting from the top row (St ∼ 10), we see that the break in the gas disc is clearly shown in the surface density proﬁle. The inner gas disc has a very steep density gradient because of the break, which causes a very narrow dust ring at the density maximum. The twist and tilt angles proﬁles show a sharp break in the gas and independent precession of the inner part, whereas the dust has a smoother radial variation. We note that this particular case only ran for 150 binary orbits because the time step becomes prohibitively short as the St number drops near the break. The second row of Fig. 6 shows the same radial proﬁles but for the St ∼ 100 case. Again we see a break in the gas disc causing steep density gradients in the inner gas disc, which forms the usual dust trap at density maxima. This eﬀect here is less pronounced than in the St ∼ 10 case since larger grains are less aﬀected by the head wind and hence the dust trap is smaller. The third row indeed shows that this particle trapping is greatly reduced for the St ∼ 1000 case, whereas the tilt oscillations in the dust are much more evi- dent for these large dust grains. The dust in this case, being eﬀectively uncoupled from the gas, behaves very similarly to the H/R = 0.1 case.  Interestingly, we note that the tearing due to binary torque only happens in the gas but not the dust compo- nent in all 3 cases. The way dust reacts to the gas break is diﬀerent for each case depending on St. For the St ∼ 10 case, the dust responds to the steep pressure gradient in the gas caused by the break by forming a dense pile up at the location of the pressure maximum, which causes two gaps in the dust at both ends of the dust trap. Note that theses gaps do not correspond to the gap in the gas component (top left in Fig. 6). For higher St, dust is less aﬀected by gas drag, and hence both the dust trap and corresponding dust gaps become less pronounced, almost completely vanishing for the highest St. This can have important implications on interpreting mm and sub-mm observations. There have been reported mechanisms explaining how a gap can open in the dust but not the gas in the presence of a low-mass planet in the disc (Dipierro et al. 2016). Our results show that tearing due to binary torques can produce the opposite eﬀect, a gap in the gas but not the dust.  We note that our relatively high mass discs induce some evolution in the binary evolution. At the end of all simula- tions the binary acquires a tilt of about 8 degrees, which  Figure 2. Density columns for gas (left panel) and dust (right panel) at the ﬁnal snapshot for the St ∼ 10 dust and H/R = 0.1 case. Top: xy-plane. Bottom: xz-plane  In the top panels we can see a few particles (a very minor fraction) that are ejected from the innermost dust ring which intersects the gas disc with a big diﬀerence in phase and tilt. The inner dust disc aligns with the binary quicker than the gas (seen in Fig. 1), therefore these ejected particles keep this low inclination. We veriﬁed that these particles have high eccentricities due to this interaction. This only occurs in the case of lowest St. since the larger St dust (bottom two panels) is able able to resist this drag-induced interaction  We note that, while the inclusion of very large dust par- ticles in a precessing disc may not be physically realistic as the dust will evolve independently from the gas before they can grow, studying the eﬀects of large St is important for two reasons: ﬁrst, depending on the gas surface density and disc size, even large St can correspond to relatively small dust particles. Second, it is not clear whether the decoupling will always happen faster than dust growth, hence includ- ing dust growth rate is of great importance in determining the largest St physically relevant in this phenomenon. We plan to investigate this in a future study. Moreover, from a theoretical point of view, it is important to study how the dynamics change for a wide range of St.  3.2 Thin discs  Misaligned circumbinary gas discs with smaller aspect ratios are prone to breaking when the binary torque exceeds the viscous torque in the disc (Nixon et al. 2013; Aly et al. 2015; Doˇgan et al. 2018). Here, we report the results of 3 simula- tions with the same St range as Section 3.1 but with H/R = 0.05. In all three cases the gas disc breaks very early on, while the dust proﬁles are generally smoother (apart from the oscillations reported above for larger grains).  MNRAS 000, 1–11 (2019)  6  Hossam Aly & Giuseppe Lodato  Figure 3.

Top to bottom: St ∼ 10, 100, and1000  explains the minimum tilt (hence maximum alignment) the disc reaches shown in all tilt proﬁles in this paper. The evo- lution in binary eccentricity and semi-major axis is however negligible.  4 CONNECTION WITH OBSERVATIONS  In section 3 we report two important new ﬁndings concern- ing weakly coupled dust particles. First, thick discs that re- sist breaking and precess almost rigidly in the gas experi- ences a diﬀerent precession proﬁle for the dust that resem- bles more closely that of test particles (hence a steeper radial gradient). The diﬀerent precession proﬁles cause dust piling up where the two components are out of phase. We stress that this is a new kind of dust trap that does not correspond to a gas pressure maximum. Second, for thin discs that are prone to breaking, we show that the break only happens in the gas component while the dust piles up in the inner broken disc due to very steep gas pressure gradient. This is in line with the usual mechanism for dust traps (Naka- gawa et al. 1986). Both phenomena are much more evident  at critical St close to 1. In this section we present a simple analysis to show how to connect this critical St regime with particle size and binary separation, so that the connection with future observations is possible. In this section we envis- age a general situation where the gas disc is large and does not precess but reaches a quasi-steady shape (as described in Facchini et al. (2013)). In this case the location of the warp (that does not imply disc breaking) is where the local precession time equals the sound crossing time.  A misaligned disc around a binary system experiences a radially diﬀerential precession with a frequency Ωp deﬁned as (Facchini et al. 2013):  Ωp =  3η 4  a2 R2 Ωk  (7)  where Ωk is the Keplerian frequency and η = M1M2/(M1 + M2)2  For a disc with a viscosity parameter less than its as- pect ratio i.e; α < H/R, relevant for a typical protoplan- etary disc, warps propagate in a wave like regime (Pringle 1992; Papaloizou & Lin 1995; Lubow & Ogilvie 2000). The propagation speed is half the local sound speed cs/2. By  MNRAS 000, 1–11 (2019)  Eﬃcient dust ring formation in misaligned circumbinary discs  7  equating the warp propagation timescale with the preces- sion timescale Ω−1 p , we get an approximate relation for a warp radius Rw:  (cid:18) Rw  (cid:19)5/2−q ∼ 3  a  proﬁle of the form  (cid:18) R  Rin  Σ = Σ0  (cid:12)(cid:12)a  R  2  η(cid:12)(cid:12) H (cid:19)−p  where q is the index for the sound speed power law.  With this expression, and assuming a surface density  (8)  (9)  we can obtain the surface density at a typical warp radius. Plugging this into the deﬁnition of Stokes number, we can estimate the dust particle size at Stokes number of order unity, i.e; where the eﬀects of radial drift are most signif- icant, as a function of binary and disc parameters. Fig. 7 shows dust particle size at this critical St and typical warp radii as a function of binary separation for diﬀerent surface density power law index p, disc mass Md, and outer radius Rout, where we assumed a disc aspect ratio H/R = 0.1 at the inner radius, dust intrinsic grain density ρ = 5g/cm2, and sound speed power law index q = 0.25. These ﬁxed param- eters have a much lesser eﬀect on the critical dust particle size than the 3 parameters we vary in Fig. 7.  We see from Fig. 7 that the ﬁndings reported here can be observed with (sub-)mm observations (eg. ALMA) for a big range of parameters, especially for lower mass discs, less steep surface density proﬁles, and wider binary separations. An interesting case is the case of GG Tau A (Cazzoletti et al. 2017; Aly et al. 2018), for which the best ﬁt orbital parameters imply a separation of 60 au and an almost equal mass binary (implying η (cid:39) 0.25). For typical disc parameters (H/R = 0.1, q = 3/2), this implies a warp radius of (cid:39) 200 au (coincident with the observed dust ring) and an inspection of Fig. 7 immediately shows that the critical dust size lies in the mm range for a wide choice of disc masses, radii and surface density slopes.  5 SMALL DUST GRAINS  5.1 Thick discs  Dust species with very low St are strongly coupled to the gas because of the strong drag force they experience. We plot the radial proﬁles of surface density, twist, and tilt angles for the St ∼ 0.002 case in Fig. 8 (top row). We can see that the dust density proﬁle very closely matches that of the gas, with only a slight indication of a dip at the outer edge due to radial drift at the end of the simulation after 1000 binary orbits. The twist and tilt angles radial proﬁles are almost identical for the gas and dust as expected. The second row in Fig. 8 shows the same radial proﬁle for the St ∼ 0.02 grains case. Here we can see that the radial drift experienced by the dust is much stronger due to the increased eﬀect of the drag force. However, the twist and tilt angles proﬁles are still very similar for gas and dust, with only a slight deviation compared to the St ∼ 0.002 case. In both cases, the disc precesses almost rigidly and smoothly goes towards alignment with the binary plane, as would be the case for a gas only disc.  Figure 4.

We show here that low St discs also break very early on. The radial proﬁles for St ∼ 0.002 (top) and St ∼ 0.02 (bottom) cases are shown in Fig. 9. In contrast to the high St simulations where the break only happens in the gas, here both gas and dust discs break at the same location with almost the same depth, due to the high coupling between gas and dust. We can also see that the St ∼ 0.02 case shows more radial drift at the outer edge of the dust disc than the lower St case, as expected. The tilt  and twist proﬁles are almost identical for gas and dust in both cases, although there is a slight more deviation in the tilt proﬁle of the St ∼ 0.02 case.  6 CONCLUSION  Misaligned circumbinary discs experience diﬀerential pre- cession due to the gravitational torque exerted by the bi- nary. We explored the rich interplay between gas and dust in mislaligned circumbinary discs by means of hydrodynam- ical simulations for a range of dust sizes and 2 diﬀerent disc aspect ratios. We ﬁnd that for thick discs that resist breaking  MNRAS 000, 1–11 (2019)  Eﬃcient dust ring formation in misaligned circumbinary discs  9  Figure 7. Dust particle size at critical Stokes number and typical warp radii as a function of binary separation. Left to right, varying surface density power law index p, disc mass Md, and outer radius Rout. For all models, we choose a disc aspect ratio H/R = 0.1 at the inner radius, dust intrinsic grain density ρ = 5g/cm2, and sound speed power law index q = 0.25  Figure 8. Same as Fig. 1. Top to bottom: St ∼ 0.002, 0.02  under the inﬂuence of gravitational torque, the gas precesses almost rigidly. Dust grains with St (cid:38) 10 experience a steeper radially diﬀerential presession proﬁle, as dust does not com- municate the warp viscously. This causes enhanced radial drift when the two discs intersect and dust pile ups at the inner disc when the two discs go out of phase. We note that this is diﬀerent from the usual dust trapping mechanisms that require the dust to be trapped at the gas pressure max-  ima. For even larger dust grains (St (cid:38) 100), we notice that dust particles are perturbed close to the binary causing tilt oscillations in the inner dust disc. These oscillations grow and propagate for the largest St simulations since they are less aﬀected by the drag force. Eventually, dust at the inner radii form a semi-spherical shape rather than a disc.  For thin discs, we ﬁnd that only the gas disc breaks, but not the dust, which can have important observational  MNRAS 000, 1–11 (2019)  10  Hossam Aly & Giuseppe Lodato  Figure 9. Same as Fig. 1 but for the H/R = 0.05 case. Top to bottom: St ∼ 0.002, 0.02  signatures. The break in the gas causes a steep density gra- dient in the inner parts, producing a strong dust trap at the local pressure maxima. The inner gas disc precesses inde- pendently from the outer part. This means that the gas and dust discs do not precess out of phase, as was the case for thicker discs.  In both the thick and the thin disc case, we have shown that a narrow dust ring is expected to form, although for diﬀerent reasons. This may be the natural explanation for the observation of thin dust rings around binary systems, such as GG Tau A (Cazzoletti et al. 2017; Aly et al. 2018) and KH 15D (Lodato & Facchini 2013; Fang et al. 2019) Highly coupled dust grains (St (cid:46) 0.1), on the other hand, tend to follow the gas more closely. The deviation between gas and dust tilt proﬁles is almost unnoticeable. However, for (St ∼ 0.1) we clearly see the eﬀects of radial drift over the lifetime of the simulation.
