Received YYY; in original form ZZZ  ABSTRACT We report on a recent bright outburst from the new X-ray binary transient MAXI J1631−479, observed in January 2019. In particular, we present the 30-200 keV anal- ysis of spectral transitions observed with INTEGRAL/IBIS during its Galactic Plane monitoring program. In the MAXI and BAT monitoring period, we observed two diﬀerent spectral transitions between the high/soft and low/hard states. The INTE- GRAL spectrum from data taken soon before the second transition, is best described by a Comptonised thermal component with a temperature of kTe ∼ 30 keV and a high luminosity value of L2−200 keV ∼3×1038 erg s−1 (assuming a distance of 8 kpc). During the second transition, the source shows a hard, power-law spectrum. The lack of high energy cut-oﬀ indicates that the hard X-ray spectrum from MAXI J1631−479 is due to a non-thermal emission. Inverse Compton scattering of soft X-ray photons from a non-thermal or hybrid thermal/non-thermal electron distribution can explain the ob- served X-ray spectrum although a contribution to the hard X-ray emission from a jet cannot be determined at this stage. The outburst evolution in the hardness-intensity diagram, the spectral characteristics and the rise and decay times of the outburst are suggesting this system is a black hole candidate.  Key words: gamma rays: observations — radiation mechanisms: non-thermal — stars: individual: MAXI J1631−479— stars: black hole, neutron star — X-rays: bina- ries.  1 INTRODUCTION  In recent years, with the advent of new space and ground- based facilities, numerous eﬀorts have been made to under- stand the X-ray emission in transient X-ray Binaries, con- taining either a neutron star (NS) or a black hole (BH). These systems are characterized by transitions between two main spectral states: the high/soft state, with the dominant soft X-ray emission originating from the accretion disc, and the low/hard state, where the dominant hard X-ray emis- sion arises from the Inverse Compton scattering of soft ther- mal photons by hot electrons in the corona (Done et al. (2007)). The evolution of the spectral and timing proper- ties are crucial to understand the accretion-ejection connec- tion during an outburst for both BH and NS systems. The evolution of an outburst is well described in the hardness-  (cid:63) E-mail: mariateresa.ﬁocchi@inaf.it  c(cid:13) 2019 The Authors  intensity diagram, which represents a useful tool to inves- tigate on the phenomenological connections between the spectral-timing states and the outﬂows modes (Gardenier & Uttley (2018); Belloni (2018); Belloni & Motta (2016); Fender (2016); Fender & Belloni (2012); Done et al. (2007); Fender (2004); Fender et al. (2004), and references therein). Although the geometry of these systems is fairly well estab- lished, the jet contribution to the high energy emission in the hard state is still unclear.  A new outburst from MAXI J1631−479 was reported on 2018 December 21 by the MAXI/GSC nova alert system reporting a bright hard X-ray outburst in the Norma region (Kobayashi et al. 2018). The X-ray ﬂux was F4−10 keV=209±27 mCrab at the inferred position of R.A. (J2000)= 247.770 deg., DEC (J2000) = -47.920 deg., with a 90% conﬁdence error radius of 10.2(cid:48). Conﬁrmation of MAXI J1631−479 as a new X-ray transient source was provided by NuSTAR observations performed on 2018 December 28  2  Fiocchi et al.  Figure 1.

On 2019 January 13 a radio counterpart for MAXI J1631−479 was detected by the Australia Telescope Com- pact Array (ATCA) observations at central frequencies of 5.5 and 9 GHz (Russell et al. 2019). A clear identiﬁcation of an optical counterpart is missing, consistently with the high col- umn density found in the NuSTAR observation. Indeed, the position of MAXI J1631−479 was observed with KMTNet telescopes (Kim et al. 2016), with the iTelescope.Net T17 and with the 1m telescope of the CHILESCOPE observa- tory (Kong 2019) and no new optical source was clear found at the position of the radio detection (Shin et al. 2019).  INTEGRAL started Norma region observations as part of the Galactic Plane Scan in revolution 2048 (2019 Jan- uary 21- 23) and MAXI J1631−479 was clearly detected by IBIS/ISGRI (Onori et al. 2019). The position of the source in the 22–60 keV energy band was R.A. (J2000)=247.814 deg, DEC(J2000)=-47.800 deg with an error radius of 0.5(cid:48) and a ﬂux F22−60 keV= 265.2±3.7 mCrab. Here, we report the results from our analysis of the IBIS/ISGRI data up to 200 keV.  2 OBSERVATIONS AND DATA ANALYSIS MAXI J1631−479 has been monitored at high energies by INTEGRAL during three revolutions: 2048, 2049 and 2050, starting from 2019-01-21T13:30 UTC (58504.563 MJD), 2019-01-24T02:47 UTC (58507.117 MJD) and 2019-01- 26T19:12 UTC (58509.801 MJD), respectively. The INTEGRAL/IBIS (Ubertini et al. 2003) consolidated data for these observations were processed using the stan- dard Oﬀ-line Scientiﬁc Analysis (osa v11.0) software, re- leased by the INTEGRAL Science Data Centre (Courvoisier et al. 2003). This software was used to obtain both spectra and light curves of the source in diﬀerent common time in- tervals and a systematic error of 2% was included. MAXI  J1631−479 was out of the JEM-X ﬁeld of view and this pre- cludes INTEGRAL detection at lower energies (¡30 keV).  The Neil Gehrels Swift observatory (Gehrels et al. 2004) collected data from this source in January 2019. We used the results from BAT (Krimm et al. 2013) observations, while the XRT (Burrows et al. 2004) data are not simultaneous with the INTEGRAL ones. In view of the strong variability of the source, a common INTEGRAL-Swift spectral study in a broad energy band is not possible. MAXI J1631−479 was also observed by the Monitor of All-sky X–ray Image (Matsuoka et al. 2009), and their data have been used in our analysis.  We use xspec v12.10.1 (Arnaud 1996) in order to ﬁt  each spectral state in the 30-200 keV energy range.  3 SPECTRAL ANALYSIS RESULTS  In order to study the hard X-ray spectral properties of MAXI J1631−479, we analyze the INTEGRAL/IBIS data taken during the three INTEGRAL revolutions, over the en- ergy range 30-200 keV.  The time evolution and the respective behavior of the diﬀerent spectral states are shown in Figure 1, where the 1-day binned light curves from MAXI1 and Swift/BAT2 are reported. The variation of the source along the outburts is clearly visible from these lightcurves. The epochs of the NuS- TAR (red line), ATCA (green line) and INTEGRAL (blue line) observations are shown for comparison. The ﬂux con- version into mCrab was obtained with the following factors: 1mCrab∼0.00022 ct cm−2 s−1 and 1Crab∼3.8 ph cm−2 s−1 for Swift/BAT 1 and MAXI/GSC 2, respectively. Although the source is within the BAT confusion ra- dius of another X-ray transient, namely AX J1631.9−4752,  1 http://MAXI/GSC .riken.jp/top/slist.html 2 https://swift.gsfc.nasa.gov/results/transients  MNRAS 000, 1–6 (2019)  05001000F(MAXI 2−20 keV) [mCrab]INTEGRAL obs.584705848058490585005851058520(MJD)585300204060200400F(BAT 15−50 keV) [mCrab]MJD−58470NuSTAR obs.ATCA radio obs.0.010.111050010001500F(2−10 keV)+F(10−50 keV) [mCrab]F(15−50 keV)/F(2−10 keV)low/hardhigh/softhigh & hardtransition to high/softABCDEtransition to high & hardlow & softthe MAXI/GSC light curve is not contaminated signiﬁ- cantly. Indeed, during the monitoring period, while MAXI J1631−479 is detected at high ﬂux levels, AX J1631.9−4752 is continuously detected at low level by Swift/BAT. The lack of contamination is conﬁrmed by the INTEGRAL/IBIS map, where the emission from AX J1631.9−4752 is lower than ∼10 mCrab (3σ upper limit) in the 30-50 keV energy range.  We performed an analysis for spectral variability by plotting the hardness versus total emission in two energy bands. Figure 1 (right panel) shows the hardness-intensity diagram for the MAXI/GSC and Swift/BAT observations. The hardness is derived using the ratio between the ﬂuxes in these two X-ray bands FBAT (2−10 keV) and is plot- ted versus the total ﬂux FBAT (2−10 keV). Each point corresponds to 1 day of time integration and only epochs for which both soft and hard X-ray data are available have been used.  (15−50 keV)/FM AXI (15−50 keV)+FM AXI  The diﬀerent colored points in the right panel of Figure 1 represent six regions we have selected from the temporal intervals. These regions correspond to the diﬀerent spectral states identiﬁed in the MAXI/GSC and Swift/BAT light curves, as shown in the left panel of Figure 1:  • 1stepoch: from MJD 58470 to 58478, the source shows a low ﬂux level at soft energy and a high ﬂux level in the hard X-ray band. This is typical behavior for the low/hard state (black points). • 2ndepoch: from MJD 58479 to 58485, the source shows an increasing soft ﬂux and a decline in hard X-ray, indicating a transition from the low/hard state to a high/soft state (red points). • 3rdepoch: from MJD 58486 to 58506, the source shows a high soft ﬂux level and is low in hard X-rays, indicative of a standard high/soft state (green points). • 4thepoch: from MJD 58507 to 58514, the source shows unusual variability during this period. A decline in the soft X-ray emission is observed for three days followed by a sud- den increase lasting for two–three days. Unfortunately, no soft X-ray data are available for the two days in between this change in the emission. In the same period, the source experienced an increase in hard X-rays corresponding to a soft X-ray decline, followed by a slight drop in hard ﬂux with a corresponding enhancement in soft X-rays. This behaviour suggests that during the ﬁrst three days the source started a transition from the high/soft state to a low/hard state. Afterwards it suddenly reversed this trend towards a new state (blue points). • 5thepoch: from MJD 58515 to 58522, the source shows a high ﬂux level in both soft and hard bands. This suggests that in this epoch MAXI J1631−479 can be considered being in a intermediate state (light blue points), where the X-ray emission can be explained with hybrid (thermal and non- thermal) Comptonization models. • 6thepoch: from MJD 58529 to 58540, the source transits towards a soft state at low luminosity level (green empty points).  The IBIS/INTEGRAL observations occurred during the 4th epoch and fall in the region of the blue points in the right panel of Figure 1 and marked as blue vertical lines in the left panel, for comparison. The IBIS observations car- ried out during revolution 2048 fall close in time to the ﬁrst  MNRAS 000, 1–6 (2019)  MAXI J1631−479 during the 2019 outburst  3  MAXI/GSC blue point (point A in ﬁgure 1, right panel). No MAXI/GSC and BAT simultaneous data are available for the second and third IBIS/INTEGRAL observations.  The left panel of Figure 2 shows the 2–4 keV and 4– 10 keV MAXI light curves (bin time 6h), together with the 30–60 keV IBIS light curve (bin time 2000 s). The variation in the source spectral state during the INTEGRAL observa- tion is clearly visible. In particular, during the ﬁrst INTE- GRAL/IBIS observation (revolution 2048) the source is in a high/soft state, however during the subsequent observa- tions (revolutions 2049 and 2050) the source ﬂux increased by a factor ∼2 in the 30–60 keV energy range, indicating the occurrence of the transition to a low/hard state.  We performed spectral analysis for the three INTE-  GRAL revolutions separately.  First, we attempted to ﬁt the spectra using a simple power law model. For the spectrum of revolution 2048 we obtain a spectral index of 3.1± 0.1 and a χ2/d.o.f. of 34/20, with residuals at high energies. Then we modelled these data with a cut-oﬀ power-law, which resulted in a best-ﬁt with χ2/d.o.f.=25/19. In this case, we obtain a spectral index Γ = 2.1+0.6−0.5, Ecutoﬀ = 62+20−22 keV and a high energy ﬂux of F30−200 keV=(2.8±0.1)×10−9 erg cm−2 s−1 . However we remark that by using the latter model the ﬁt improvement is only marginal. Indeed, applying the appropriate F-test statistics for model comparison (Press et al. 2007; see also Orlandini et al. 2012), we obtain an improvement probability of only about 28%.  In order to obtain the physical parameters of the source, we also ﬁt this dataset using a model describing the Comp- tonization of soft photons in a hot plasma (comptt in xspec, Titarchuk 1994). The resulting Comptonized plasma has a temperature of ∼29 keV and optical depth τ ∼ 0.7, with the input soft photon Wien temperature ﬁxed at the default value (0.1 keV), not aﬀecting the high energy spectrum. The best ﬁt parameters are listed in Table 1. In the right panel of Figure 2 the spectrum of revolution 2048, together with residuals with respect to the cut-oﬀ power-law model are shown (black ﬁlled triangles).  When ﬁtting the IBIS data of revolutions 2049 and 2050 separately, we obtain similar results, both in ﬂux and in spectral shape. This is also evident from Figure 1 (right panel), where IBIS observations fall in the same hardness region (between points C and D). Using a simple power law model, we obtain a spectral index of 3.0 ± 0.2, a ﬂux of F30−200 keV=(5.9±0.2)×10−9 erg cm−2 s−1 and a χ2/d.o.f. of 20/20 for revolution 2049 and for revolution 2050 (Γ = 3.0±0.2, a ﬂux of F30−200 keV=(5.9±0.2)×10−9 erg cm−2 s−1 and a χ2/d.o.f. of 20/20). No high energy cutoﬀ is required for these data. Taking into account the spectral similarity, similar ﬂux levels and hardness, data from revolutions 2049 and 2050 have been combined to improve the statistical qual- ity of the spectra and to better constrain the physical pa- rameters, as reported in Table 1. The resulting spectrum together with the residuals with respect to the power law model are shown in Figure 2 with red squares (right panel).  4 DISCUSSION MAXI J1631−479 belongs to a class of transient systems showing spectral state transitions.  4  Fiocchi et al.

This intermediate value of the electron temperature conﬁrms that the source is not in a standard high/soft or low/hard state. Joinet et al. (2008) found a similar corona temperature (∼ 30 keV) when the microquasar GRO J1655– 40 transits from low/hard to hard/intermediate state. This temperature of the thermal population was also previously  observed in GX 339-4 (Motta et al. (2009)) before the source transits from low/hard to hard/intermediate state. In this case the high energy cutoﬀ disappears near the hard/intermediate-soft/intermediate transition. This behav- ior is similar to the MAXI J1631−479 evolution: the high energy cutoﬀ was not detected by INTEGRAL/IBIS when it moved towards a soft state at low luminosity. Indeed it is detected up to about 200 keV though the best ﬁt is a simple power law (Γ ∼ 3) suggesting a non-thermal origin for this X-ray emission. This behavior continued in later observa- tions, as noted in Figure 1, where the light blue points show that the source moved towards an intermediate state at a high ﬂux in both soft and hard bands.  Transitions from low/hard state to high/soft state and then towards an intermediate state with high ﬂux at these energies has previously been observed in black hole sys- tems (Done et al. 2007; Belloni 2018). The no-detection of a high energy cutoﬀ using X-ray data up to 200 keV sug- gests that the hard X-ray emission may not be produced by thermal Comptonization. The observed spectrum in the intermediate state can be produced by Compton scatter- ing on a non-thermal electron population (Gilfanov 2010) or by a mixture of thermal and non-thermal features (Coppi 1999; Del Santo et al. 2008). The shape of the hysteresis diagram of MAXI J1631−479 appears similar to the one of the black hole X-ray binary XTE J1550−564 (Russell et al. 2010). Moreover, MAXI J1631−479 showed radio emission at 5.5 and 9 GHz when it was in the high/soft state (Russell et al. 2019) and a similar behaviour was reported for XTE J1550−564. For that system, the authors were able to iso- late the non-thermal emission from the jet and demonstrated that the synchrotron jet may dominate in hard X-ray when the source fades in the low/hard state, at very low lumi- nosity level. In this case, the jet produces ∼ 100% of the emission when the soft (3-10 keV) and hard (100-250 keV) ﬂuxes are comparable.  In the case of MAXI J1631−479, Figure 2 shows that X-ray power-law component is observed when the soft and  MNRAS 000, 1–6 (2019)  012(2−4 keV) [c/s]00.511.5(4−10 keV) [c/s]36384042444648406080100(30−60 keV) [c/s]MJD−58470Rev. 2048Rev. 2049Rev. 20500.1110keV2 (Photons cm−2 s−1 keV−1)Rev. 2049+2050Rev. 204810050200−4−2024(data−model)/errorEnergy (keV)−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−Energy (keV)hard ﬂuxes are comparable, although the energy ranges are slightly diﬀerent from those used for XTE J1550−564.  Unfortunately, for this source neither the distance nor the mass of the central object are known. In order to esti- mate the possible luminosity range of MAXI J1631−479 , we used the extreme values of distances and masses known so far for X-ray binaries. In particular, the distances span from 1 kpc (McClintock & Remillard 1986) to 27 kpc (Casares et al. 2004), while the black hole masses can assume values from 4 M(cid:12) ( ¨Ozel et al. 2010) to 15.65 M(cid:12) (McClintock & Remillard 1986; Orosz et al. 2007). Using realistic values for a LMXB, the luminosity of MAXI J1631−479 during the in- termediate state can vary from 5×10−1 LEdd (distance=20 kpc and mass=4 M(cid:12)) to 3.5×10−4 LEdd (distance=2 kpc and mass=15.65 M(cid:12)). Thus, as the emission of the jet in X- ray band can be dominant when the luminosity is between L∼2×10−3 LEdd and L∼2×10−4 LEdd (Russell et al. 2010), the wide range of possible values derived for the luminosity of MAXI J1631−479 do not allow us to exclude a contribute of the jet to the X-ray emission in MAXI J1631−479.  The lack of a high energy cut-oﬀ indicates that the X- ray emission from MAXI J1631−479 has a non-thermal ori- gin that can be produced either by Comptonization of non- thermal electron population or by a hybrid thermal/non- thermal electron distribution.  The source outburst evolution and the typical times of the outburst suggest the BH nature of this source. In- deed, assuming the time spent to reach from 10% to 90% of the ﬂux peak as the rise time and the reverse for the de- cay time, we obtained τrise ∼15 days and τdecay ≥50 days though it seems the outburst has not yet ended (see Fig 1, left panel). These values are compatible with decay and rise times for BH and incompatible with much faster evolution times for NS, reported in the statistical study of Yan and Yu (2015). This result is in agreement with previous studies performed at diﬀerent energy bands during the same out- burst. When MAXI J1631−479 transits from a low/hard to high/soft state (red line of Figure 1, ∼58480 MJD) the NuSTAR 3–79 keV spectrum is well modelled by a disk- blackbody with a temperature of ∼1.12 keV, a power-law with a photon index of ∼2.39 and iron Kα emission line with an equivalent width of ∼ 90 eV (Miyasaka et al. 2018). Based on these spectral characteristics the authors suggested the system as a black hole binary in the high/soft state with most of the ﬂux in the soft X-ray band (F2−10 keV=1.7×10−8 erg cm−2 s−1 and F3−79 keV=1.8×10−8 erg cm−2 s−1 ). Rus- sell et al. (2019) also report a similar conclusion on the source nature by using the radio observation performed on 2019 January 13 (green line of Figure 1, ∼58496 MJD). A radio counterpart of MAXI J1631−479 was detected by Aus- tralia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) with a ﬂux den- sity of F5.5 GHz=(630 ± 50) µJy and a radio luminosity L5 GHz=(9.5 ± 0.8)×1028 (d/5 kpc)2 erg s−1.  This radio emission could indicates the presence of a compact jet, as it was detected during the transition from high/soft to low/hard state, i.e. when synchroton jet emis- sion could became dominant at X-ray wavelengths and at low luminosities.
