Classical Cepheids are blue loop stars that have famously been dubbed “magnifying glasses of stellar evolution” and have been studied for a long time. As more and more precise observations of Cepheids are secured over ever-increasing temporal baselines, our ignorance of the physics governing these crucial stars is becoming increasingly clear. Thus, it is time to turn up the magniﬁcation and investigate the limitations of our understanding of classical pulsators. Of course, classical Cepheids are also standard candles thanks to the Leavitt law that allows to measure distances in the nearby Universe. Nowadays, Cepheids serve as the backbone of a precisely calibrated distance ladder that allows to measure Hubble’s constant (H0) to better than 2%, thus providing crucial constraints for precision cosmology. The recently established discord among H0 values measured in the late-time Universe and inferred from observations of the early Universe requires utmost diligence in estimating systematic uncertainties in order to strengthen the signiﬁcance of the results. In this presentation I focus on two main aspects of recent Cepheid-related research. First, I present the Geneva Cepheid Radial Velocity survey (GE-CeRVS) and an update on the modulated spectroscopic variability exhibited by the 4 d Cepheid QZ Normae based on 8 years of monitoring. Then, I discuss some eﬀorts directed towards a 1% H0 measurement needed for understanding the cosmological implications of discordant H0 values. Finally, I argue that now is a particularly opportune time to leverage the synergies between stellar physics and observational cosmology.  Keywords: niques: radial velocities, distance scale  Stars: variables: Cepheids, Stars: oscillations, Line: proﬁles, Methods: observational, Tech-  1 Introduction  Classical Cepheids (henceforth: Cepheids) are evolved intermediate-mass high-amplitude radially pulsating stars with important applications for stellar astrophysics and cosmology. The variability of these very luminous stars provides insights into a stellar evolutionary phase that is notoriously diﬃcult to model — the blue loop during core He burning — and allows to determine precise (extragalactic) distances thanks to the Leavitt law (Leavitt & Pickering 1912). Importantly, Cepheids form the backbone of the currently most precise distance ladder used for measuring the local expansion rate of the Universe, H0, which has become a focus of observational cosmologists, since recent precise measurements of H0 diﬀer by approximately 9% depending on whether they are based on the late Universe (“today”) or the early Universe as it was 13.8 billion years ago (Riess et al. 2019, and cf. Verde et al. 2019 for a recent conference summary).  Despite the long history of astronomical research involving Cepheids (Goodricke 1786) and the precision of the modern distance ladder, recent research has increasingly identiﬁed a wealth of phenomena that defy explanation and are relevant for many diﬀerent sub-ﬁelds of astronomy & astrophysics, including the evolution of multiple stars, the eﬀects of rotation, convection, and other internal mixing processes, the relation between mass and luminosity, and the variability content of Cepheids, in particular concerning the regularity of Cepheid pulsations. Hence, I would argue that the adjective “classical” should not be considered synonymous with “well-understood”, and that digging deeper to identify and understand these issues will help to progress to a better understanding of how stars and the cosmos evolve. Additionally, a reinforced astrophysical basis for the objects that calibrate the distance ladder is required for strengthening the interpretation of discordant H0 values as an indication of new physics beyond the concordance model of cosmology, that is, ﬂat ΛCDM.  1 European Southern Observatory, Karl-Schwarzschild-Str. 2, 85748 Garching b.

Since 2011, GE-CeRVS has gathered > 19000 observations of > 300 candidate Cepheids. GE-CeRVS operates on two 1m-class tele- scopes that provide access to the full sky: the Flemish Mercator telescope located at the Roque de los Muchachos Observatory on the island of La Palma, Spain, and the Swiss Euler telescope at the La Silla site of the Euro- pean Southern Observatory in Chile. Both telescopes feature eﬃcient ﬁber-fed high-resolution optical echelle spectrographs (Queloz et al. 2001; Raskin et al. 2011). While RVs measured with Hermes reach approximately  10− 15 m s−1 precision, the simultaneous wavelength reference provided by Coralie’s Fabry-P´erot etalon aﬀords a precision of 1 − 2 m s−1 for bright objects. Thanks to their high precision, dense pulsation phase coverage,  and multi-year baseline, GE-CeRVS data provide an unprecedented view of the spectroscopic variability of Cepheids. Additionally, they provide a crucial reference for understanding RV variability measured by the RVS instrument on-board the Gaia spacecraft (Wallerstein et al. 2019). Among other things, GE-CeRVS data have shown that Cepheid RV signals are modulated on diﬀerent timescales. Speciﬁcally, Anderson (2014) showed that short-period (overtone?) Cepheids QZ Nor and V335 Pup exhibit long-term changes in their RV ampli- tudes, whereas long-period Cepheids (cid:96) Car and RS Pup exhibit cycle-to-cycle variations in pulsation period, RV amplitude, and line proﬁles (cf. also Anderson 2016).  The following subsection provides a work-in-progress update on this initial discovery 5 years ago and illus- trates this surprising long-term behavior for the short-period Cepheid QZ Nor. In addition to RV measurements, it considers the Bisector Inverse Span (BIS) (for a visualization, see e.g. Anderson 2016, their Fig. 2), which provides a useful and precise measure of spectral line asymmetry.  2.2 Monitoring QZ Nor for 8 years  Figure 1 shows the GE-CeRVS time series RV and BIS measurements of the 3.79 d Cepheid QZ Nor, whose modulated RV curve was ﬁrst reported by Anderson (2014). As is clear from the ﬁgure, both the RV amplitude and the line proﬁle asymmetry traced by the BIS quantity exhibit long-term changes throughout the 8-year time scale of the observations.  Figure 2 separates the RV variability into epochs of 16.1 d duration and illustrates that each epoch is rea- sonably well sampled, exhibiting fairly simple variability curves that can be represented by low-order Fourier series. However, Fig. 3 shows that the pulsation-averaged RV (vγ) and the RV amplitude (ARV) exhibit cor- related changes over time. This is important because the top panel in Fig. 3 resembles a low-amplitude high- eccentricity orbit, and would likely be interpreted as such if the bottom panel did not imply a contemporaneous change in ARV. In other words, Fig. 3 cautions us against interpreting all temporal variations on the order of even 1 km s−1 as signs of orbital motion, contradicting the typical interpretation of such signals. At present, it remains unclear whether these changes are (quasi-)periodic or repeating, not to mention what causes these phenomena. (Derekas et al. 2017) reported the previously longest modulation seen in a Cepheid for the only classical Cepheid in the original Kepler ﬁeld, V1154 Cyg, with a period of 1160 d based on a light curve spanning 1470 d. Unfortunately, we do not yet know whether photometric and spectroscopic modulations correspond to each other. This is mostly because precise long-timescale photometric monitoring of bright stars is not available, whereas spectroscopic observations do not exist in suﬃcient quantity for fainter Cepheids, e.g. in the OGLE ﬁelds (e.g. Soszy´nski et al. 2019). However, Anderson et al. (2016) showed that interferometric observations suggest that (cid:96) Car exhibits cycle-to-cycle changes in its maximum diameter. High-quality contemporaneous photometric and spectroscopic time series are required for understanding these phenomena and casting open these exciting windows into stellar pulsations.  As explained in Anderson (2018), diﬀerent ways of measuring RV in Cepheids have diﬀerent merits and potential issues. In GE-CeRVS, RV is deﬁned as the center of a Gaussian line ﬁtted to the cross-correlation proﬁle, which is the standard in precision RV measurements of stable stars (Baranne et al. 1996; Pepe et al. 2002). Astrophysical eﬀects can change the shape of line proﬁles over time, out of sync with the dominant radial mode pulsation. Such eﬀects can lead to spurious changes in the mean velocity by introducing time-dependence in the bias of RVs measured using Gaussian ﬁts to asymmetric line proﬁles. Although this complicates the interpretation of vγ as an indicator for spectroscopic binary motion, this is useful for identifying previously unknown hydrodynamical eﬀects, such as coupling between pulsations and convection (Anderson 2016). Another  R. I. Anderson: Cepheids under the magnifying glass − not so simple, after all!  239  Fig. 1. GE-CeRVS data of the 3.79 d (overtone?)

Until recently, a prime motivation for pursuing this factor of 10 improvement over the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Key Project (Freedman et al. 2001) was an improved ability to elucidate the nature of dark energy. Indeed, a 1% H0 measurement used as prior for determining the equation of state of dark energy would optimally support future developments in observational cosmology Weinberg et al. (2013). In as much as it is acceptable to use H0 as a prior for the analysis of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), this motivation remains true and important. However, recent works have found a conspicuous disagreement between measurements of H0 based on the late-time Universe (as it is “today” by cosmic standards) and the value of H0 inferred from observations of early Universe physics, such as the CMB or Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (cf. Verde et al. 2019, for an overview). Notably, there is a ∼ 9% diﬀerence (at 4.4σ signiﬁcance) between a faster late- Universe H0 and a slower early-Universe value based on an extragalactic distance scale composed of classical Cepheids and type-Ia supernovae (Riess et al. 2019) and observations of the CMB by the Planck satellite (Planck Collaboration 2018). This Hubble tension challenges the adequacy of the concordance cosmological model, which connects the present-day Universe with the oldest observed radiation and describes the Universe as ﬂat,  560005650057000575005800058500BJD-2.4M[d]−45.0−42.5−40.0−37.5−35.0−32.5−30.0RV[km/s]560005650057000575005800058500BJD-2.4M[d]−2.0−1.5−1.0−0.50.00.51.01.5BIS[km/s]240  Stars and their variability observed from space  Fig. 2.

If it can be shown that new physics are required to solve this conundrum, then we may well be near a breakthrough in our understanding of the Universe and its evolution.  Classical Cepheids play a crucial role for increasing the precision of H0 measurements for several reasons. As easily recognizable and very luminous stars, Cepheids provide the absolute calibration of type-Ia supernovae, whose distance-redshift relation deﬁnes the Hubble-Lemaˆıtre law. Although Cepheid alternatives such as Mira stars (Huang et al. 2019) and stars near the Tip of the Red Giant Branch (Freedman et al. 2019, TRGB) have made tremendous progress over the last few years, they have not yet reached the same precision as that currently oﬀered by Cepheids and it remains to be seen which type of primary standard candle will ﬁrst be limited by systematic uncertainties. Hence, it is crucial to determine the systematic “error ﬂoor” of Cepheids (and other standard candles) and to pay particular attention to previously neglected or overlooked systematic eﬀects.  Anderson & Riess (2018) recently examined a frequently mentioned, albeit poorly quantiﬁed, systematic uncertainty of the distance ladder: stellar association bias. In particular, we considered the eﬀect of stellar multiplicity and cluster membership on the modern H0 measurements as implemented by Riess et al. (2016), rather than describing the eﬀects on the Leavitt law (or period-luminosity relation). The latter exercise provides a valuable test of stellar physics, that is whether stellar models correctly predict observed Leavitt laws. In terms of a systematic error or bias of H0, however, it is most important to consider the equivalence between Leavitt laws observed in nearby and more distant Cepheid populations.  The bias arises because Cepheids are relatively young (30-300 Myr old) evolved supergiant stars that oc- casionally in open star clusters or loose associations (e.g. Turner et al. 2010; Anderson et al. 2013). On Local Group scales, star clusters are easily recognized and spatially resolved. At the average supernova host galaxy distance of 23 Mpc, however, the typical physical cluster scale of 4 pc is equal to the plate scale of HST’s WFC3 in UVIS mode (0.04”). Thus, stars physically associated with Cepheids do not contribute to the calibration of the Leavitt law, which is done locally, but do contribute light to distant Cepheids on the second rung of the distance ladder. Figure 4 illustrates this. Stellar association bias is diﬀerent from chance blending of ﬁeld stars because the latter is corrected using artiﬁcial star tests, whereas cluster light contributions cannot be easily corrected in distant galaxies.  Using M31 as a supernova-host analog for its high metallicity, spiral structure, and external view, Anderson & Riess (2018) measured the light contributions for 9 cluster Cepheids using HST photometry from the PHAT project (Dalcanton et al. 2012). Cluster positions were known from the Andromeda Project (Johnson et al. 2015) and Cepheid positions from the PanSTARRS survey (Kodric et al. 2018), M31’s cluster Cepheids were highlighted by Senchyna et al. (2015).  Interested readers are referred to Anderson & Riess (2018) for the details of the analysis. Suﬃce it here to state that the bias was estimated as the product of the clustered Cepheid fraction times the average bias measured using curve-of-growth analysis of 9 M31 cluster Cepheids. We ﬁnd that on average a Cepheid’s distance is underestimated by 7.4 mmag using a reddening-free Wesenheit magnitude that combines V , I, and  RV[km/s][-47.785,-27.965]BJD[d](span:16.1d)−39.0−38.8−38.6−38.4RVmean[km/s]560005650057000575005800058500BJD-2.4M[d]15.015.516.016.5RVamp[km/s]R.

Distinction between chance blending (left) and blending of physically associated stars that leads to biased extragalactic measurements and H0 (right). Chance blending can be corrected statistically by measuring ﬁeld star contributions. However, blending of physically associated stars cannot be corrected in this way, since the physical scale of stellar association in clusters is unresolved at typical supernova-host galaxy distances.  H-band photometry, and by 9.8 mmag when using H-band only. Corrections for these light contributions are now included in the H0 measurements by Riess et al. (2019). Further work in this direction will clarify the adequacy of the adopted clustered Cepheid fraction and the eﬀects of selection criteria applied to extragalactic Cepheid samples on this bias.  Of course, Cepheids very frequently occur in multiple star systems (e.g. Evans et al. 2015; Kervella et al. 2019b,a). However, companion stars contribute a bias of < 0.004% because most conﬁgurations of companion stars are rarely spatially resolved (Anderson & Riess 2018). This estimate was based on the Geneva stellar evolution models (Ekstr¨om et al. 2012; Georgy et al. 2013; Anderson et al. 2016) and the properties of Cepheid orbits (Moe & Di Stefano 2017).  Another bias aﬀecting the distance scale due to inherent diﬀerences between near and far Cepheid populations concerns the dilation of variability periods due to cosmological redshift. As shown in Anderson (2019b), time dilation has previously led to a 0.3% underestimate of H0. However, this bias will increase as future work will focus on more and more distant Cepheids in order to increase the number of supernova-host galaxies, which is limited by the rate of supernova explosions in the nearby Universe. For reference, Leavitt law distances to pulsating stars at 100 Mpc would be biased by 2% if redshift is not accounted for. Thus, future distance scale work aimed at a 1% measurement of H0 must account for dilated variability periods, for example using observed host galaxy redshifts.  4 Synergies between precision cosmology and stellar physics  Extragalactic pulsating stars (e.g. Cepheids & Miras) provide the backbone of the extragalactic distance ladder and the associated measurement of H0 sets the scale and age of the Universe. As we are pursuing a 1% H0 measurement (or better), additional scrutiny is required to ensure that systematic uncertainties that could shift the center value of H0 are under control at the same level, or better. Given that the primary distance ladder rungs dominate the uncertainty budget of the H0 measurement (cf. Riess et al. 2019), further scrutiny is required to identify and mitigate systematics aﬀecting Cepheid distances. This leads to wonderful opportunities for studying populations of extragalactic Cepheids in diﬀerent environments (star formation, galactic potentials, chemical composition, etc.) that can provide new insights into stellar pulsations and the evolution of stellar populations.  At the same time, precision observations of the closest Cepheids reveal surprising new phenomena, such as multi-periodic variability (cf. above) or diﬃcult-to-explain circumstellar environments (Hocd´e et al. 2019). Moreover, long-term photometric monitoring of Cepheid pulsation periods challenges the canonical interpreta- tion of observed rates of period change as indicative of secular evolution (e.g. Poleski 2008; S¨uveges & Anderson 2018). These are fundamental new insights into stellar astrophysics, which ultimately explain the mechanisms upon which the distance ladder rests. Of course, mmag-level non-radial pulsations and short-term period ﬂuc- tuations do not immediately lead to biases in measuring H0. However, such work may allow us to select cleaner samples of Cepheids exhibiting tighter Leavitt laws that ultimately increase distance ladder precision and accu-  Field starsResolution elementCepheidBackgrndannulusr = 4pc = 0.04” at 23 MpcUnresolved host cluster242  Stars and their variability observed from space  racy. With large time-domain surveys such as Gaia and LSST (cf. contributions by L. Eyer and G.
