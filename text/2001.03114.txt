However, the massive white dwarf (WD) with mass of about 0.61 M⊙ has a high eﬀective temperature (48900 K), and the lower mass WD with mass of about 0.21 M⊙ has a low eﬀective temperature(<10000 K). It is challenging the popular theory of binary evolution. We investigate the formation of ZTFJ1539 via nova and Algol scenarios. Assuming that the massive WD in ZTFJ1539 just experiences a ther- malnuclear runaway, nova scenario can explain the eﬀective temperatures of two WDs in ZTFJ1539. However, in order to enlarging a semi-detached orbit of about 4—5 minutes to a detached orbit of about 7 minutes, nova scenario needs a much high kick velocity of about 200 km s−1 during nova eruption. The high kick velocity can result in high eccentricity of about 0.2—0.6. Algol scenario can also produce ZTFJ1539 if we take a high eﬃcient parameter for ejecting common envelope and enhance the mass-loss rate via stellar wind trigger by tidal eﬀect.

INTRODUCTION  The gravitational radiation can be produced by these binaries with short orbital periods. The LIGO/Virgo detectors have successfully observed the gravitational waves (GWs) emit- ted in the kHz regime by several mergers of double black holes and a merger of a double neutron stars(Abbott et al. 2016, 2017, 2018). In fact, comparing with double black holes and neutron stars, double white dwarfs (DWDs) are dominated(Nelemans et al. 2001a). In the Milk Way, Nelemans et al. (2001b) esti- mated that there are about 107 DWDs emit- ting gravitational waves in the mHz band. These GWs can be detected by the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) which can observe the GWs with a band of about 0.1 and 1000 mHz(Amaro-Seoane et al. 2017). Cornish & Robson (2017) estimated that LISA can ﬁnd about 104 DWDs.  Recently, based on the updated distances from Gaia Data Release 2, Kupfer et al. (2018) gave 13 binary systems which can emit GWs strong enough to be detectable by LISA. Very recently, Burdge et al. (2019) observed an eclipsing DWD ZTF J153932.16+502738.8 (ZTFJ1539) with an orbital period of 6.91 minutes, which is the shortest in detached DWDs. The GW emitted by this DWD is closed to the most sensitive LISA’s band, and LISA can detect it within a week(Burdge et al. 2019). Therefore, ZTFJ1539 is a signiﬁcant source of LISA de- tecting GW(Littenberg & Cornish 2019)  For the theory of binary evolution, scenario is very interesting. The primary and sec- ondary WDs have masses of about 0.61 and 0.21 M⊙(Burdge et al. 2019), respectively. In this paper, the WD with larger mass is called as the primary WD, while another is called as the secondary WD. Usually, in DWDs, the primary WD ﬁrst forms, and its cooling timescale is shorter than that of the secondary WD. Surpris- edly, the eﬀective temperature of the primary  WD is about 48900±900 K, which is higher than the temperature (< 10000 K) of the secondary WD(Burdge et al. 2019). Burdge et al. (2019) gave two possible explanations. One is tidal heating. Due to extremely short orbital period, tidal distortion dissipates the tidal energy in the WD, which results in heating and spinning up WD(Fuller & Lai 2013). Another is recent ac- cretion which results in a nova eruption. Having considered that the temperature of WD heated by the tidal distortion through more realistic calculations is closed to 25000 K, Burdge et al. (2019) suggested the latter scenario better.  Theoretically, in DWDs, the accretion should occur in semi-detached systems, and result in X-ray emission. However, ZTFJ1539 is a detached system and is no detectable X-ray emission(Burdge et al. 2019). Therefore, there should be a mechanism for a transition from semi-detached system to detached system if ZTFJ1539 undergoes nova eruption. In ad- dition, it is possible that the secondary WD may form earlier than the primary WD if binary experiences mass transfer to become Algol system(e. g., Dervi¸soˇglu et al. 2010; van Rensbergen et al. 2011).  In this paper, we investigate the possibility for ZTFJ1539 produced by nova eruption with a kick velocity or Algol systems. In §2 section, we simulate the nova eruptions in DWDs, and discuss the possibility of forming ZTFJ1539 via nova scenario. The Algol scenario producing ZTFJ1539 is discussed in §3. The main conclu- sions appear in §4.  2. NOVA SCENARIO  Nova eruption usually appears in binary sys- tem in which a thermal nuclear runaway occurs on the surface of WD accreting material from its companion. In general, most of compan- ions in nova binaries are normal stars (main se- quence or giant stars), while about 60 nova bina- ries have hydrogen-deﬁcient companions(e. g., Gallagher & Starrﬁeld 1978; Belczy´nski et al.  2000; L¨u et al. 2006; Ramsay et al. 2018). The former is called as cataclysmic variables (CV), and the latter is called as ultra-compact cataclysmic variables (AM CVn). However, ZTFJ1539 is a DWD binary. It is composed of a CO WD with mass of about 0.61 M⊙ and a He WD with mass of about 0.21 M⊙(Burdge et al. 2019). If the He WD ﬁlls its Roche lobe, mass transfer occurs. Marsh et al. (2004) investi- gated the stability of mass transfer between DWDs. If mass transfer is stable, ZTFJ1539 will undergo a nova eruption, and evolve into an AM CVn(Burdge et al. 2019). If the trans- fer is not stable, it could evolve into a R Coro- nae Borealis Stars(e. g., Clayton 2012; Han 1998). In order to simulate the nova eruption in ZTFJ1539, we must construct the models of He and CO WD.  2.1. Nova model  Modules for Experiments in Stellar Evolution (MESA, [rev. 11108]; Paxton et al. (2011, 2013, 2015, 2018)) oﬀers a test suite for producing He WD and CO WD. Using MESA, we cre- ate CO WDs with masses of 0.5, 0.6 and 0.7 M⊙, and He WDs with masses of 0.15, 0.20 and 0.25 M⊙, respectively. Figure 1 shows the evolutions of the eﬀective temperature, radius, gravity acceleration and luminosity during WD cooling phase. The cooling age of a nascent WD with mass of 0.6 or 0.2 M⊙ which evolves to the state of the primary or the secondary in ZTFJ1539 is respectively about 2.4 M or 300 M years, which is consistent with the estimate of Burdge et al. (2019). Based on Figure 1, the primary or the secondary can be covered by single-star model. However, ZTFJ1539 is a DWD. According to popular binary theory, the WD with mass higher in DWD should be cooler because it is older and its cooling timescale is shorter. Burdge et al. (2019) considered that the primary in ZTFJ1539 just experienced a nova eruption. Its primary and secondary are CO WD and He WD, respectively. It means  3  that the nova is triggered by the helium-rich material accreted by the primary from the sec- ondary. Very recently, using the FUN evolution- ary code combined with a large nuclear network, Piersanti et al. (2019) simulated the nova erup- tions produced by helium-accreting WD in AM CVn stars.  In this work,  following Denissenkov et al. (2013, 2014); Zhu et al. (2019), we use test suit case nova in MESA to simulate nova eruption in ZTFJ1539. Based on the observations of Keck I, Burdge et al. (2019) found that narrower hy- drogen emission lines apparently come from the cooler secondary, and the irradiated surface of the secondary had some weak neutral helium It is diﬃcult to determine the emission lines. chemical compositions of the secondary. In our model, we simulate nova eruptions trigged by hydrogen-rich or hydrogen-deﬁcient accreted materials. The chemical compositions of the former are X(H) = 0.7, X(He) = 0.28 and Z = 0.02, they for the latter are X(H) = 0.0, X(He) = 0.98 and Z = 0.02. The abundances of metal elements are similar with those of the Sun.  2.2. Discussions  Figure 2 gives the evolutions of the eﬀective temperatures, the radii, the gravitational ac- celeration and the luminosities for WDs after novae reach the maximum luminosity. Both of hydrogen-rich and hydrogen-deﬁcient models give similar results. The primary of ZTFJ1539 can be explained by WD which has experienced a nova eruption about 8000 yr ago. Compared with the radius and the gravitational acceler- ation of the primary, the model of WD with 0.5 M⊙ mass is better. However, both of them greatly depend on the hydrogen mass around WD surface. In our simulation, we consider the mass loss when the luminosity of nova exceeds the Eddington luminosity, and may underesti- mate the hydrogen mass. In addition, they also depend on the WD cooling which is also aﬀected  4  Figure 1. The evolutions of the eﬀective temperature, radius, acceleration gravity and luminosity during WD cooling phase are given in the left panels. The eﬀective temperature vs. the radius is showed in the right panel. The black and red lines represent He and CO WDs, respectively. The line styles represent WDs with diﬀerent masses. The black and red stars give the positions of He and CO WDs in ZTFJ1539. The observational data come from Burdge et al. (2019).  by the convection, the radiative transfer, crys- tallization, and so on (Wood 1992; Hansen 1999; Liu & L¨u 2019).  Usually, the nova in DWDs should occur in semi-detached systems. However, ZTFJ1539 is a detached binary. Burdge et al. (2019) con- sidered that the orbit was widen because an amount of mass (10−4M⊙) was ejected during nova eruption. In order to discuss this ef- fects, considering that the nova eruption may be aspherically symmetric and following the method of investigating the kick velocity of supernova in Brandt & Podsiadlowski (1995); Hurley et al. (2002), we assume that the WD also receives a kick velocity when it ejects an amount of mass. The kick velocity vk abides by Maxwellian distribution  P (vk) = r 2  π  k  v2 σ3  k  e−v2  k/2σ2 k .  (1)  In this work, σk is taken as 50 and 200 km s−1, respectively.  By a method of synthesis population, we con- struct a sample of 107 binary systems(Details can be seen in L¨u et al. 2011, 2012, 2013; Zhu et al. 2013, 2015). The initial mass func- tion comes from Miller & Scalo (1979), a con- stant mass-ratio distribution is considered  (Mazeh et al. 1992), and the distribution of sep- arations is taken as  log a = 5X + 1  (2)  where X is a random variable uniformly dis- tributed in the range [0,1] and a is in R⊙.  Using the rapid binary star evolution (BSE) code (Hurley et al. 2002), we obtain about 3.4× 105 CO + He WDs from 107 binary systems. The panel (a) of Figure 3 gives the distribution of the primary masses and the orbital periods for nascent CO + He WDs. Due to the gravita- tional release, the orbits of these systems shrink. Within Hubble times, about 44% of them evolve into semi-detached systems which are showed in the panel (b) of Figure 3. Because the He WDs in our simulations have very thick hydro- gen envelopes (∼ 10−5M⊙), their orbital periods are shorter than about 6 minutes when the He WDs ﬁll their Roche lobe. If some He WDs have very thick hydrogen envelopes, and thus can ﬁll their Roche lobes at longer periods. When the WD with larger mass in the semi-detached systems accretes the matter from its compan- ion, the nova eruption occurs. Burdge et al. (2019) found that the orbit of ZTFJ1539 only widened slightly if mass of 10−4M⊙ was ejected during a nova eruption, and ZTFJ1539 would  5  Figure 2. The evolutions of the eﬀective temperature, radius, gravitational acceleration and luminosity after novae reach the maximum luminosity. The left four panels are for nova eruptions trigged by hydrogen- rich accreted materials, and the right four panels are for hydrogen-deﬁcient accreted materials, respectively. The black, red and green lines represent the nova models with CO WD’s masses of 0.5, 0.6 and 0.7 M⊙, respectively. The solid, dashed, dot-dashed and dotted lines represent the nova models with the mass- accretion rates of 10−7, 10−8, 10−9 and 10−10 M⊙yr−1, respectively. The black star gives the observational value of the primary in ZTFJ1539(Burdge et al. 2019).  become a semi-detached system again in about 100 yr after a nova eruption. However, as Fig- ure 2 shows, the primary of ZTFJ1539 may have evolved for about 8000 yr after a nova eruption. In fact, based on the theoretical model, the mass ejected during a nova eruption is between about 10−3 and 10−8M⊙(Yaron et al. 2005; Zhu et al. 2019). Compared with WD mass, the mass ejected is too small. It hardly results in a large orbital widening.  In our work, we consider the eﬀects of kick velocity. However, as the panel (c) of Figure 3 shows, the kick velocities with σk = 50 km s−1 can not widen the orbits up to 6 minutes. When σk increases to 200 km s−1, ZTFJ1539 can be covered by our simulation. Simultaneously, kick velocity can also result in an elliptical orbit. Figure 4 shows the distributions of eccentricities for σk = 50 and 200 km s−1, respectively. Our results mean that the eccentricity of ZTFJ1539 should be between about 0.2 and 0.6 if the orbit of ZTFJ1539 is broadened from about 5 minutes to 6.91 minutes by nova eruption. Usually, a bi- nary system with high eccentricity undergoes a large degree of apsidal precession which would manifest itself in the eclipse timing residuals.  However, Burdge et al. (2019) believed that the eccentricity of ZTFJ1539 should be zero be- cause any sign of apsidal precession was not be detected.  In fact, Hobbs et al. (2005) analysed the proper motion of 233 pulsars, and suggested that σk of core-collapse supernova (CCSN) is about 265 km s−1. In general, the energy re- leased by CCSN is higher than 104 times en- ergy from nova eruption. Therefore, σk of nova eruption should be very small. In short, it is not a probability to explain the observational properties of ZTFJ1539 by experiencing a nova eruption.  3. ALGOL SCENARIO  Algol system is a binary where the less massive donor ﬁlls its Roche lobe and transfers its mat- ter to the more massive gainer which does not ﬁll its Roche lobe, and the former is the cooler, fainter and older star while the latter is still on the main sequence(Peters 2001). In the present paper, Algol scenario means that the progenitor of ZTFJ1539 undergoes the phase of Algol bi- naries so that the less massive WD forms earlier than the more massive WD.  6  Figure 3. The primary masses vs. the orbital pe- riods of CO + He WD systems. The panel (a) rep- resents the nascent CO + He WDs, and the panel (b) gives the semi-detached CO + He WDs. The panels (c) and (d) show the CO + He WDs after nova eruptions with kick velocity of σk= 50 and 200 km s−1, respectively. The red star gives the position of ZTFJ1539.  Figure 4.

The dashed line gives the orbital period of ZTFJ1539.  3.1. Model of Binary Evolution  It is well known that the interaction of bi- nary systems produces many diﬀerent types of  astronomical phenomena. However, some in- volved physical processes are still open, such as common envelope evolution (CEE). The impor- tance of CEE in binary evolution has been dis- cussed by many literatures(e. g., Ivanova et al. 2013). In general, the formation of DWD system experiences CEE once or twice(e. g., Postnov & Yungelson 2014). Unfortunately, it is extremely challenging to simulate real CEE via both computation and analytic treatment. In the last section, using BSE code, we obtain about 3.4 × 105 CO + He WDs via a method of population synthesis. In BSE code, the treat- ment of CEE is determined by the initial bind- ing energy of the envelope and the initial or- bital energy of two cores(Details can be seen in Hurley et al. 2002). CEE is aﬀected by two pa- rameters: αCE and λ. The former (αCE ) is the eﬃciency of the orbital energy used to expel the envelope(Paczynski 1976), and the latter (λ) is related to the structure of the donor(de Kool 1990; Xu & Li 2010). In fact, the outcome of CEE in BSE code depends on the product of αCE and λ(Hurley et al. 2002; L¨u et al. 2006, 2012).  In the previous section, we use combining pa- rameter λ×αCE = 1.0 to calculate binary evolu- tions. Figure 5 shows the distribution of WDs’ masses when He + CO WD systems form. Ob- viously, He + CO WD systems can be produced via Algol scenario. These systems is showed in the left-top zone of Figure 5. Unfortunately, the He WD’s masses of these systems are higher than about 0.25 M⊙, while the secondary’s mass of ZTFJ1539 is only 0.21 M⊙. However, the products of binary systems are aﬀected by many uncertainty input parameters.  In order to eﬃciently produce Algol systems in RS CVn binaries, Tout & Eggleton (1988) sug- gested that mass-loss rate of a giant star via stellar wind can be tidally enhanced by  ˙M = ˙MR[1 + BW max(  1 2  ,  R  RL  )6],  (3)  7  tens, even several hundreds. Simultaneously, some literatures have also taken αCE larger than 1. For example, the default value of αCE in BSE code is 3(Hurley et al. 2002).  Figure 6 gives the diﬀerent products for a bi- nary with similar initial conditions under diﬀer- ent assumptions: λ × αCE = 1.0 and BW = 0, or λ × αCE = 4 and BW = 104. As one can see, a large BW can produce a He WD with lower mass, and a large λ × αCE can ensure low-mass He WD survival during CEE.  3.2. Discussions  Figure 7 gives the results of He + CO WDs via the population synthesis method under as- sumptions of λ × αCE = 4 and BW = 104. The primary and secondary masses in ZTFJ1539 can be covered by He + CO WDs produced via Al- gol scenario. However, we must mention that the results are sensitive to the values of two pa- If BW < 103, He WD with a mass rameters. lower than about 0.27 M⊙ hardly forms. If λ × αCE < 2, binary systems with low-mass He WD hardly survives during CEE.  Figure 8 shows the distributions of orbital pe- riod vs. CO WD’s masse for He + CO WDs pro- duced via Algol scenario during diﬀerent ages. Based on the temperature of the primary WD in ZTFJ1539, Burdge et al. (2019) estimated that its cooling age should be about 2.5 Myr. The right-top panel in Figure 8 gives the distribu- tion within 2.5 Myr after the formation of He + CO WDs. Our results cover the observations of ZTFJ1539, including the distribution when the cooling age is about 25 Myr. Therefore, it is possible in our binary model to produce ZTFJ1539.  In the this work, through only changing pa- rameters λ × αCE and BW, we can explain the observational properties of ZTFJ1539 via Al- gol scenario. In fact, there are still other un- certain parameters which can aﬀect the binary evolutions, such as mass-transfer rates and the eﬃciency of mass-accretion during Roche lobe  Figure 5. Distribution of WDs’ masses when He + CO WD systems form. The left panel repre- sents all He + CO WD systems, while the right panel is for these He + CO WD systems which can merge within the Hubble time. Red star rep- resents ZTFJ1539 where M1 is the primary and M2 is the secondary, that is, M1 = 0.61M⊙ and M2 = 0.21M⊙. However, blue star represents ZTFJ1539 where M1 = 0.21M⊙ and M2 = 0.61M⊙. Dashed line means a position where M1 = M2. The He + CO WD systems locating the left-top zone is produced via Algol scenario.  ˙MR is the mass-loss rate from Reimers where, (1975), R and RL are the stellar and Roche- lobe radius, respectively. Here, BW is an uncer- tain parameter. Comparing with the observa- tions, Tout & Eggleton (1988) took BW as 104. As Figure 6 shows, the model with BW = 104 can eﬃciently produce less massive He WD. However, this also results in a low orbital en- ergy because the mass lost by stellar wind car- ries out the orbital angular momentum. Under the assumption of λ × αCE =1.0, the less mas- sive He WD merges with its companion when this binary experiences CCE. Therefore, we take λ × αCE =4 so that the binary with a low-mass He WD can survive after a CCE. In many liter- atures, the parameters λ and αCE are assumed less than 1.0. However, λ and αCE are very un- certain. Xu & Li (2010) calculated λ, and found that its range changes from ≪ 0.5 to several  8  Figure 6.

With more DWDs like ZTFJ1539 ob- served in the future, it will contribute to check whether Algol scenario can produce ZTFJ1539. Simultaneously, the observations for them will restrain these uncertain parameters in the the- oretical model for binary evolution.  4. CONCLUSIONS  In this work, we investigate the formation of ZTFJ1539 via nova and Algol scenarios. As- suming that the massive WD in ZTFJ1539 just experiences a thermal runaway, nova scenario can explain the eﬀective temperatures of two WDs ZTFJ1539. Unfortunately, in order to enlarging a semi-detached orbit of about 4—5 minutes to a detached orbit of about 7 min- utes, nova scenario needs a much high kick ve- locity of about 200 km s−1 during nova erup- tion, which can be comparable with the kick velocity of CCSN. However, the energy released by CCSN is higher than about 104 times en- ergy from nova eruption. Simultaneously, this high kick velocity can result in a high eccentric- ity of about 0.2—0.6. There is no observational  9  evidence for high eccentricity. Therefore, it is not a probability to produce ZTFJ1539 by nova scenario. If the enhancement of the mass-loss rate of a giant star via stellar wind triggered by tidal eﬀect and a high eﬃciency of ejecting CE are considered, Algol scenario can also produce ZTFJ1539.  As a signiﬁcant source of gravitational ra- diation close to the peak of LISAs sensitiv- ity, ZTFJ1539 has attracted attention. In the meantime, ZTFJ1539’s progenitor and its desti- nation involve many unsolved physical processes of binary evolutions, such as CEE, mass loss, and binary merger, and so on. It is worth in- vestigating ZTFJ1539 further.
